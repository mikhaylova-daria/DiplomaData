History

The village is named for Robert Byrd Caldwell, its original landowner. The name of Caldwell has been conspicuous in the annals of Duck 
Creek Valley from the earliest history of that region, to the present day. 
The progenitor of the Noble County Caldwells was Robert Caldwell, a 
native of Chester County, Pa. He was a man of much natural abil- 
ity and of giant force of character, these traits being inherited from 
his Scotch-Irish ancestors. He served as a teamster in the Revolutionary War, married and settled in Pennsylvania, and in 1795 emigrated 
to the Northwest Territory, settling in Washington County, Ohio, where 
were then the chief settlements in the territory. He explored this sec 
tion of the county, and by the advice of General Putnam, made a selection 
of the land on which he afterward located. In the year 1808 he came 
up the west fork of Duck Creek with his sons and began an improvement 
on the present Caldwell farm. He was, therefore, among the earliest 
pioneers of the valley, and the first to make a clearing where the town 
of Caldwell now stands. Robert Caldwell died in 1831. His wife's 
maiden name was Jane Fulton, who was also a native of Pennsylvania, 
and a niece of Robert Fulton, the pioneer steam navigator. Their 
children (several of whom were born in Pennsylvania), were Robert*, John, 
Joseph, Samuel, Hiram, Jane, Polly, Elizabeth, llebecca, Matilda and 
Xancy. The sons are all dead except Joseph. They were all prominent 
fanners, and resided in Noble County. Of the daughters, Jane married Rod- 
ney Severance, and died in Morgan County. Polly married James 
Logan, remained in Pennsylvania, and died there. Elizabeth, the 
widow of David Archibald, is still living in Noble County. Rebecca 
(deceased) was tlie wife of John Noble. Matikhi, the wife of John 
Rrownrigg, is still living in Noble County. Nancy became the wife of 
Samuel Price, and died in Morgan County.

Caldwell is the location of the Thorla-McKee Well, believed to be the first oil-producing well in North America.

The Pennsylvania Railroad arrived to Caldwell in the 1870s.

While passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over Ohio early in the morning of 3 September 1925, the airship USS Shenandoah was torn apart and crashed in several pieces near Caldwell.

Cross country team
Caldwell High School's cross country team had one of the most dominant runs by any Ohio High School Athletic Association team, winning small-school state championships every year from 1985 to 1992 and the National Championship in 1986. During several of these years, they were also arguably the best team in any division, since they beat the best large-school state champions from those years in regular-season races. Mah Dugan Hill, who was also on a 1973 state title team at Caldwell, coached those teams, and in still coaching at CHS continues to produce many solid state-qualifying teams. The Ohio Association of Track and Cross Country Coaches elected him to their Hall of Fame in 1996 and awarded him the Ed Barker award in 2006 for these outstanding accomplishments.
