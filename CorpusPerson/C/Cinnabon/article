History
The first Cinnabon opened on December 4, 1985 in Federal Way, Washington (a suburb of Seattle) in Sea Tac Mall. Cinnabon was an offshoot of the Seattle Based Restaurants Unlimited restaurant chain run by Ray Lindstrom. Mr. Lindstrom wanted to create the worlds most "perfect" cinnamon roll, eventually hiring Jerilyn Brusseau to finalize the iconic recipe. The first bakery began by serving only its Cinnabon Classic cinnamon roll. Cinnabon's first franchise-operated store opened in August 1986 in Philadelphia. In 1991, the first Cinnabon store outside a mall was opened in Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Cinnabon stores today can also be found in military bases, universities, rapid transit stations, casinos, and amusement parks.

Cinnabon was bought by AFC Enterprises, Inc. in 1998 for $65 million. In 2004, AFC Enterprises, Inc., sold Cinnabon for $30.3 million to FOCUS Brands, Inc., which is owned by the Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group. The headquarters moved to Greater Atlanta in 1999.

Cinnabon has many international franchise operations, including in major cities of Pakistan (Karachi and Lahore), Cyprus, Poland, and its largest branch outside the United States and Canada is in Stars Centre in Cairo. The restaurant is noted for being the first U.S franchise to open in Libya after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In Alberta and British Columbia Cinnabon is called Cinnzeo.

Ingredients and preparation

Cinnabon says it uses "Makara" cinnamon, a variety of Cinnamomum burmannii, from Indonesia. Pillsbury says that their Grands cinnamon rolls and Cinnamon Toaster Strudel are made with Cinnabon's Makara cinnamon.

Cinnabon's buns are made from rolled up dough. They are prepared in one of three ways, depending on the store operator's preference:

#Freezer-To-Oven, also known as FTO, where the rolls are made in a factory and sent to the stores frozen;
#Prepared Dough, where the dough is received frozen, then is thawed and made into rolls on location; and
#From scratch, where stores still make the dough fresh in a mixer from flour, a proprietary base mix of dry ingredients, margarine, yeast, and other ingredients.

Customers can easily recognize the last two preparations, because the rolling process is in plain view if the rolls are made on-site.

Cinnastix initially come as Danish pastry sticks. A mixture of margarine and vanilla extract is brushed on, then the sticks are dipped in a cinnamon and sugar mixture, twisted, and placed on a pan to bake.
