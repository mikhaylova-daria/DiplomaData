David Thomas Michael Prutton (born 12 September 1981) is an English footballer, currently a free agent after being released by Sheffield Wednesday.

He has previously played for Nottingham Forest, Southampton, Leeds United, Colchester United and Swindon Town, as well as representing England at Under 21 level 25 times. He spent a 3-month loan spell with Scunthorpe United at the start of the 2012–13 season and a brief spell on loan at Coventry City at the end of the 2013-4 season.

 Playing career 

 Nottingham Forest 
Prutton was born in Hull, and came through the Nottingham Forest youth system, going on to make 155 appearances for the club where his career started. Having starred for Nottingham Forest and in the England under-21 squad the versatile midfielder was signed by Southampton, then of the Premiership, on the final day of the transfer window for £2.5 million in 2003.

 Southampton 
Prutton is a versatile player, having played across the midfield and at right-back for Southampton, and despite being a very important player in the 2002–03 season missed out on the FA Cup Final as he was cup-tied having played for Nottingham Forest against West Ham in the third round. Despite only being at Southampton for less than four months Prutton played 12 games for Southampton and impressed in Gordon Strachan’s squad.

In the 2003–04 season Prutton featured heavily for Southampton, playing 30 games and scoring one goal against Charlton Athletic, on the last day of the season.

The 2004–05 season was one to forget, despite scoring 2 goals (one against European champions Liverpool) and playing 28 games in all competitions. Following Southampton's home game with Arsenal on 26 February 2005, Prutton was charged by the FA on two counts for the events following his red card for a tackle on Robert Pirès. First was for his failure to leave the field of play promptly following his dismissal and his attempt to remonstrate with the assistant referee, during which he pushed the referee, Alan Wiley, on at least one occasion. The second charge relates to his threatening words and/or behaviour towards a match official. Prutton was handed a 10-match ban and fined £6,000 after admitting the two charges of improper conduct. Prutton returned on the final day of the season for Southampton's game against Manchester United, which the side needed to win to stay in the Premiership. Southampton lost the game 2–1 and the club were relegated to the Football League Championship.

In 2005–06 the versatile midfielder's season was marred by a broken metatarsal which he picked up in September against Queens Park Rangers.

A lack of first team opportunities forced him to seek employment elsewhere and in January 2007 he left Southampton to return to Nottingham Forest. In total he played 94 games for the Saints, scoring 5 goals. He was released by Southampton on 23 May 2007.

 Return to Nottingham Forest 
Narrowly beating the transfer deadline, Prutton re-joined his old club in January 2007 on loan until the end of the season, with a view to a permanent move if Forest were promoted. He had piqued interest from Championship clubs Leeds United and his home-town club, Hull City.

On 14 April, Prutton scored his first Forest goal since returning to the club against Brentford in a league match, heading in the first of Forest's four second-half goals to inspire a fightback that would win Forest the game 4–2, despite being 2–0 down after 50 minutes. He was sent-off in 90th minute of the League One play-off semi-final second leg match against Yeovil Town on 18 May 2007, leaving Forest with 10-men for extra time.

 Leeds United 

Prutton joined Leeds United on trial during pre-season 2007 and officially joined the club on 7 August 2007. Prutton scored his first goal for Leeds against Swansea City on 22 September 2007 in a 2–0 victory as Leeds notched up their seventh consecutive victory. Prutton generally played in a right midfield role during Dennis Wise's rule at the club. When Gary McAllister became manager, Prutton was moved to his natural central midfield role, and put in several man-of-the-match performances. He was one of Leeds' most consistent performers in the 2007–08 season, having started over 40 matches and winning several man of the match awards along the way. Leeds reached the playoff final that season but lost 1–0 to Doncaster Rovers. Prutton also became a cult hero amongst the Leeds fans, due to his humour in interviews, and also his Jesus-Like appearance. Leeds retained the services of Prutton for the next season, with his contract lasting a further year. Following Simon Grayson's appointment as Leeds United manager, Prutton became somewhat of a peripheral figure in Leeds United's first team squads; despite starting in Grayson's first game on Boxing Day against Leicester City, Prutton found chances hard to come by for the remainder of the season. Leeds lost to Millwall in the playoff semi finals that season, with Prutton having a bit part role since Grayson took over, with him having to settle for a place as a substitute.

With seven substitutes required for the 2009–10 season, Prutton made the bench regularly, and made a rare start for Leeds in the League game against Oldham Athletic. Prutton started for Leeds in the Football League Trophy game against Accrington Stanley and provided an assist for Hogan Ephraim's goal. The match was to be Prutton's last start for Leeds, with him having to settle for a place on the bench until he departed the club.

 Colchester United 
On 26 January 2010, Prutton joined League One side Colchester United on a month-long loan deal, with a view to make the move permanent. The same day, Prutton made his debut for Colchester, coming off the bench against Milton Keynes Dons and scoring a long-range effort. Prutton's loan was set to be made permanent after Colchester played against Prutton's employers, Leeds United. Prutton wasn't allowed to play in the game due to the terms of the loan deal.

On 1 February, Prutton was released from his contract at Leeds United, and signed a six-month deal at Colchester United. Prutton was offered a new contract by Colchester manager Aidy Boothroyd in the close season; the deal remained on the table when John Ward took over following Boothroyd's departure to Coventry City, but Prutton rejected the deal.

 Swindon Town 
On 5 July 2010, he signed for Swindon Town on a two-year deal, joining up with former Leeds team-mates David Lucas and Jonathan Douglas. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw with Brentford on 21 August 2010. On 26 March Prutton scored his third goal for the robins, netting away to long time leaders Brighton. He left Swindon in 2011 to play for Football League One team Sheffield Wednesday on a free transfer after Swindon were relegated to Football League Two.

 Sheffield Wednesday 
On 24 May 2011, Prutton signed for Sheffield Wednesday on a two-year deal.

He made his debut for the Owls in their first game of the 2011/12 campaign, against Rochdale at Hillsborough. He scored his first goal for the club in that game, a sensational volley from the edge of the 18-yard box in the 72nd minute.

On 27 March 2014, Prutton joined League One side Coventry City on loan until the end of the 2013–14 season.
