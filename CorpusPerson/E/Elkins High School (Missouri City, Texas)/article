History
Lawrence E. Elkins High School was established as a grade 9 and 10 school in Fall 1992 to alleviate overcrowding from three other district high schools, Dulles, Clements, and Willowridge.

Academies
The Engineering Academy is a unique opportunity for high school students to explore their interest in the field of engineering. The goal of the program is to inform and excite students about the potential of
a career in engineering. Courses include Engineering Principles & Systems and Engineering Computer Applications and are meant to form a strong foundation of engineering knowledge. Advanced Engineering Internship is also offered in which students are able to work alongside professional engineers.

In Internship, students will work with NASA and other programs dedicated to the engineering arts and studies. While elective classes include the classical courses in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, emerging courses also include those in the area of Domestic Engineering and Waste Management.

Athletics

Clements / Elkins Rivalry

In 1992, after Elkins was built to alleviate overcrowding from William P. Clements High School, zoning issues forced many families in different subdivisions around the city of Sugar Land to send their children to both high schools. Still today, it is not uncommon to find next door neighbors or siblings going to opposing schools as feeder middle schools and zoning patterns overlap.

In 1996, after an outbreak of Senior Pranks between the two schools, the principals of both high schools decided to focus the rivalry in a less destructive manner. After meeting with both schools' Student Councils, the principals decided to hold an annual, year-long competition.

Each school's athletic program can earn points based on wins against the other school in UIL competition. The competitions include: Boys' Football, Basketball, Baseball, and Soccer, and Girls' Volleyball, Basketball, Softball, and Soccer. A school earns one point when it defeats the rival school. A game ending in a tie score will award both teams one-half point. As often occurs, the schools sometimes meet more than once per year. In the event of a tie for the overall competition, the school's band that is ranked the highest at the Texas UIL Regional Marching Band Competition will be the year's winner.

Since 1997, the schools have held the competition every year. As both schools' mascots (the Ranger and the Knight) typically ride horses, the "Golden Horse" trophy is awarded and displayed in the champion school's trophy case at the beginning of each new school year.

Baseball
The Knights baseball program has been one of the most successful team sports in Fort Bend ISD history. The Knights have posted a record of 479-180-8 in the 20 seasons they have fielded a Varsity team. Elkins has also won 10 District Championships, advanced to the State Tournament 6 times, winning the State 5A Championship 3 times (1995, 2002, 2003) and finishing as Runner Up once, in 1998. The Knights were also named 2002 National Champions by Baseball America, USA Today, and Student Sports. From 1994-2007, the Knights were led by legendary Texas high school coach Rick Carpenter, father of current St Louis Cardinal Matt Carpenter. The program is currently coached by Tyler Porter, a 1995 graduate of Elkins High School.

Notoriety

Cyber-bullying
Elkins, along with other Fort Bend High Schools Dulles and Clements, was subject to an act of cyber terrorism when a list titled Whimsical Girls of FBISD was posted on Facebook in April 2010. The list named several female students from the three high schools with graphic detail of promiscuous acts that the girls performed, locations of the acts, as well as severe name calling. While some described this as tattle-taling, others argued that the list was a direct form of verbal assault and demanded the expulsion of the offender who posted the list.

Staff
On March 13, 2008, former Vice-Principal Jon Jeffrey Jones was caught by Sugar Land Police looking through the window of a home containing a woman and several children.
