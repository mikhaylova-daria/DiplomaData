Eric Stuart (born October 18, 1967) is an American voice actor, voice director, singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He is also the lead singer of the Eric Stuart Band.

Life and career
Stuart was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a modern dancer mother and a criminal attorney father. He is known for the English-dubbed anime voices of Brock and James in Pokémon (the first 10 years, seasons 1-8), Seto Kaiba in Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Gourry Gabriev in Slayers among others.

As a stage performer, he has toured with Peter Frampton (1999, 2000), Ringo Starr (1997), and Lynyrd Skynyrd (1997) and has opened for Jethro Tull (1997), Julian Cope (1995), Hall and Oates (1997, 1998), and Chicago (1995, 1997, 1998) as well. While influenced by many artists (such as Buddy Holly, Bruce Springsteen, Cat Stevens, Elvis, Neil Diamond, Jim Croce, and The Beatles), his own musical style does not conform to any specific genre. Much of his music follows the styles of rock, folk, or country). His band has released six albums and one EP to date, five of which are presently available worldwide.
