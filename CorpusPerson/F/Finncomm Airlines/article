Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy operating as Flybe Nordic, trading as Finncomm Airlines, was a regional airline with its head office on the grounds of Seinäjoki Airport in Ilmajoki, Finland, near Seinäjoki. The carrier operates flights to Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, Romania, Sweden and 16 destinations within Finland from its base at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. The airline is a member of the European Regions Airline Association. Finncomm Airlines is the largest domestic air carrier in Finland in terms of number of flights.

The company was replaced by Flybe Nordic in 2011.

 History 

In 1993, Juhani Pakari and his father started Finncomm Airlines as an Air Taxi business flying light aircraft to remote airstrips which other carriers did not serve. Seeking to acquire an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) to begin scheduled flights, Finncomm partnered with Swedish carrier Golden Air in 1999 until Finncomm could receive their own AOC. The original Golden Air fleet consisted of seven Saab 340s and one Saab 2000.

In September 2003, Finncomm received their own AOC and operations began with one Embraer ERJ-145s leased from Swiss International Airlines. Inaugural services between Helsinki and Stuttgart were followed by flights to Düsseldorf and Oslo with the arrival of a second ERJ-145 from Swiss International Airlines in April 2005.

At the 2005 Paris Air Show, Finncomm announced a $250 million contract for eight ATR-42-500 aircraft with options for a further eight. With the arrival of the ATR-42 in late November 2005, the airline could begin to retire the Saab fleet inherited from Golden Air.

In 2006, at the Farnborough Air Show, Finncomm signed a contract which converted four of their ATR-42 orders to the larger ATR-72-500. This was further supplemented by the purchase of an additional three ATR-72 aircraft at a list price of $54 million.

In January 2008 the carrier announced another order for a further five ATR-72-500 aircraft with deliveries between 2009 and 2011. Once all the orders have been fulfilled by ATR, Finncomm will become the largest operator of the ATR-500 series in Europe.

On 9 September 2010, Finnair Group announced that they have signed a preliminary agreement to acquire all the aircraft from Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy and 20% of Finncomm Airlines Oy for the total sum of €48 million. The schedule for completion of the purchase is yet unknown. Finncomm will however remain their own identity and continue operations normally in the Finnair Group.

On 1 July 2011, Finnair and Flybe announced they will jointly buy Finncomm for €25 million. The company will be renamed Flybe Nordic. 60% of shares will be owned by Flybe while Finnair will own 40%.

Operations
Finncomm currently employs over 250 staff and in 2008 the carrier flew 870,000 passengers, an increase of 45% over the previous year despite a tough economic climate. The growth allowed an operating profit of over €9.4 million which was a 9.8% increase over 2007. The airline expects to carry over 1,000,000 passengers in 2009. 

Finncomm co-operates with Finnair to provide feeder traffic for their international route network.

The Finnish Civil Aviation Authority (FCAA) ordered some changes to Finncomm's operating procedures and temporarily increased their weather minimums in ATR operations following an incident in late 2006. The incident is currently under investigation and some re-training was ordered by FCAA for pilots regarding new operating procedures. Weather restrictions are no longer in effect and normal operations have resumed.

Finncomm have announced plans to possess 16 ATR-500 series aircraft by the end of 2011, suggesting they plan to convert at least 3 of their options into firm orders.

 Environment 
Finncomm Airlines has made many efforts to mitigate their environmental impact. The carrier utilises a very modern and fuel efficient fleet of ATRs and Embraers which reduce fuel burn and noise emissions. Finncomm commented that the ATR fleet saves 70,000 tonnes of fuel and 200,000 tonnes of CO2 in a five-year period over a jet fleet. Furthermore, when aircraft are at an airport overnight, they are placed into heated hangars to reduce the amount of de-icing agent used on the aircraft. Finncomm states that this action saves 300,000 litres of anti-ice solvents annually.
