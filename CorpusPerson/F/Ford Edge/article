Second generation



For 2015, the Edge is all-new from the ground-up with a new Fusion-like grill, new headlights, new interior room, and a rear-view camera. The new Edge now comes with a standard EcoBoost engine—the all-new 2.0-liter (only the displacement and bore-center spacing carry over) gets a new twin-scroll turbo to fatten the low end of the torque. Unlike the current 2.0-liter EcoBoost, this one will be rated to tow 3500 pounds and will be available with all-wheel-drive (output and fuel-economy figures haven't been announced yet). Next up is a 3.5-liter V-6, which will probably produce 285 hp and 253 lb-ft as before. The top-of-the-line choice, powering Sport models, is the 2.7-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V-6, probably rated near the 2015 F-150 version's anticipated 325 hp/375 lb.

For the first time, Ford will market the Edge in European markets (as part of the company's "One Ford" ideology); it is set to sit above the Ford Kuga.
