Fort Plain is a village in Montgomery County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the village population was 2,322. The village is named after a fort built on a plain at the junction of the Mohawk and Osquaga rivers, during the American Revolution.

The village of Fort Plain is at the border of the Towns of Minden and Canajoharie and is west of Amsterdam.

Because of its small size and the close connections with neighboring communities, some former residents who now live in more populous regions use Fort Plain to refer collectively to the actual village of Fort Plain and the surrounding villages of Nelliston, Canajoharie, and Palatine Bridge.

History
The village is in a region where a branch of the Mohawk had four major villages. 
In 1738, the governor of New York built a stone house for the use of his sons. Other early settlers included Palatinate Germans.

The village is built at the foot of the hill where the fort once stood. The fort, a Revolutionary War fort, was constructed in 1776 and a blockhouse was maintained here throughout the war. While many of the village's men were fighting elsewhere, the women, dressed as men, were able to fend off Indian attacks by manning the walls of the fort.

Fort Plain became an incorporated village in 1832. The opening of the Erie Canal was an economic boom. It became a center of manufacturing during the Nineteenth century for textiles and furniture.

Fort Plain is also the birthplace of the first black professional baseball player, Bud Fowler. Fowler appeared in an exhibition game with a team from Lynn, Iowa in 1878, 68 years before Jackie Robinson played in a professional baseball game.

Fort Plain is also home to a large number of Amish and now, Montgomery County has one of the largest populations of Amish in the country.

The Fort Plain Conservation Area and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
