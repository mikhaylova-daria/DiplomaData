Frances Barber (born 13 May 1958 in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England) is an Olivier Award-nominated English actress who has appeared in stage and television productions.

Personal life
Barber studied drama at Bangor University, in Wales where she was a contemporary of director Danny Boyle, who became her boyfriend. One of her closest friends is the actor Ian McKellen, who funded a library in her name in India. In 2006, she received an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Wolverhampton.

Scottish independence
In 2013 Natalie McGarry, Scottish advocacy columnist and convenor for the Scottish National Party, stated on Newsnetscotland.com that she was involved in a social network Twitter correspondence with a 'Frances Barber' over the integrity of Scottish American actor Alan Cumming commenting on Scottish independence. McGarry said that this "baffling... interlude" descended to verbal insult by the 'Frances Barber' account. In August 2014, Barber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. In September 2014 she was seen referring to all pro-independence voters as "thugs" on the same account. 

Career
Stage
With Pet Shop Boys, she appeared in their musical Closer to Heaven in 2001 as well as guest singer for the song "Friendly Fire" on their 2006 live concert at the Mermaid Theatre.
