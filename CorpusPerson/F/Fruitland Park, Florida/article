History

Fruitland Park predates the American Civil War, although the name of the town didn't come until later. It was originally called Gardenia. The earliest settler was M. Calvin Lee, of the Evander Lee family of Leesburg, who planted a citrus grove. After the war, a son-in-law of the Lee family, P.S. Bouknight, homesteaded near Mirror Lake.

In 1875 the State of Florida sent Captain Kendricks to the northern part of the US to talk about the advantages of living in Florida. Due to Major Orlando P. Rooks poor health, and already considering a move, he had his wife, Josephine, moved to Fruitland Park. They built their first home on Crystal Lake in 1877. It was here that the first white child, Frederic, was born in 1882.

The Fruitland Nurseries of Augusta, Georgia, was owned by J. P. Berckmann, friend of Major Rook. Major Rook named the town Fruitland Park for the nurseries, and the main street Berckmann Street for this friend.

The postal authorities refused to recognize the name Fruitland Park as there was already a Fruitland in the State. At their request the name was changed to Gardenia in 1884. The Florida Railroad, put through the town just prior to this, had listed the town as Fruitland Park in all their printed matter and refused to recognize the new name of Gardenia. Consequently, all freight and express had to be directed to Fruitland Park and all mail addressed to Gardenia. This caused a great deal of confusion which lasted from 1884 to 1888 when a petition was sent to the postal authorities to have the name changed back to Fruitland Park. The petition was granted in 1888.

On December 20, 1884, Rev. G.W. Butler organized the first "community" church in Fruitland Park. The church had acquired to lots on College Ave., between Fountain St. and Lime St. The church was built in 1886-1887. That building burned in 1934, but was rebuilt in 1935. That building was later sold to the United Pentecostal Church and still remains today.

Fruitland Park was granted a Charter by the State of Florida on May 25, 1927.

Today the city boasts churches, schools, and numerous businesses. It still calls itself "Hometown USA."lake.k12.fl.us/16582055172312593/site/default.asp
