*IB Art - Students study art and design and are evaluated towards their final years on the merits of their Investigation Workbooks or art portfolio. This is followed by an art show and allows for students to independently evaluate themselves during the process.

School of Performing Arts

The School of Performing Arts was approved by the GISD School Board. Graduates of the School of Performing Arts receive the Performing Arts Endorsement, sequence of courses designed for the artistically gifted/talented student and offers the opportunity to concentrate on the Performing Arts and gain proficiency in chosen areas of concentration during the high school years, much as a Music or Theatre Major does in college.

Upon completion of the prescribed course of study, a Performing Arts Endorsement shall be awarded to the student. This endorsement will accompany their official transcript, along with an explanation of the endorsement and its criteria, and will become applicable to university study or future professional endeavors. The Performing Arts Endorsement has been reviewed by both university and secondary administration. It has received praise for both its inclusiveness and its practicality.
