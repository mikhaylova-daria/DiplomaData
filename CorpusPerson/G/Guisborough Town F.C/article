History
Guisborough Town Football Club formed in 1973 and after winning the Middlesbrough & District League and the South Bank & District League they were soon entered into the Northern Alliance. There is however evidence to show that there were football teams in the town as Guisborough pre-dating them, such as Guisborough Belmont Athletic as far back as the 1920s, and a team named simply Guisborough from the 1940s.

Guisborough finished top of the Northern Alliance in the 1979–80 season, and reached the final of the FA Vase tournament that same season, losing 2–0 to Stamford FC at the original Wembley Stadium.

Guisborough then played in the Midland League for two seasons, ending in 5th position in both occasions, before becoming a founding member of the Northern Counties East League where they played for the next three seasons.

In 1985, Guisborough joined Division Two of the Northern League. After spending just two seasons in the league they were promoted to Division One, having finished second in Division Two in the 1986–87 season.

Guisborough remained in Division One for the next eighteen years, before being relegated back to Division Two at the end of the 2004–05 season after being docked six points for twice fielding ineligible players. The club completed an excellent season in 2010–11 where they only lost 6 League games and finished Runner's Up earning promotion to the First Division (2011–12).

The captain of the club David Onions achieved the very rare feat of scoring a hat trick of hat tricks in 3 consecutive matches. He also captained the side to victory in the North Riding Senior Cup final defeating Marske United 1–0.

During the 1988–89 season, Guisborough made their sole appearance in the FA Cup First Round, narrowly losing 1–0 to professional side Bury at Middlesbrough's Ayresome Park.

Guisborough Town gained promotion at the end of 2010–11 back to the First Division, only being beaten 6 times in the League, scoring 110 League goals (124 including Cups) and winning the North Riding Senior Cup beating Middlesbrough, Stokesley, Thornaby and Marske United.
