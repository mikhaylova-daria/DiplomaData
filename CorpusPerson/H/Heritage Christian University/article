Heritage Christian University is a primarily undergraduate university in Florence, Alabama. It is affiliated with churches of Christ.

The university is governed by a Board of Directors, all of whom must be active members of the churches of Christ.

 History 
Heritage Christian University was founded in 1971 as International Bible College when the newly formed Board of Directors asked Charles Coil to become the school’s first president.

Coil soon persuaded Basil Overton, a well-known preacher in the churches of Christ, to become the school’s Vice President. Together, Coil and Overton established The World Evangelist, a monthly newsletter for churches. At the height of publication, The World Evangelist had more subscribers than any other paper in churches of Christ.

Coil remained the university’s president until a decline in health forced his retirement. Dennis Jones became the school’s second president on January 1, 1990. Under Jones’ leadership, the school added a graduate program and changed its name from International Bible College to Heritage Christian University.

 Academics 
Heritage Christian University offers a 128-hour undergraduate program leading to a bachelor’s degree in Biblical Studies. All students major in Bible and may choose a minor in Biblical History, Biblical Languages, Counseling, Family Life (Youth) Ministry, New Testament, or Old Testament.

In the graduate program, the university offers a 36-hour curriculum leading to either the of Arts or the Master of Ministry. Students enrolled in the MA program may choose a major in one of three categories: Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism, History of Biblical Interpretation and Theology, or New Testament and Early Christian Literature. Master of Ministry students have the option of choosing majoring in Ministerial Counseling, Homiletics/Ministerial Care, History of Biblical Interpretation and Theology, and Biblical Studies. Instead of a thesis, MMin students participate in a practicum “that specifically addresses the needs of a Christian community.” On June 27, 2011, Heritage Christian University announced that the school had been approved to offer the Master of Divinity degree. 

Heritage Christian University is accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education. The ABHE is a member of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and is recognized as a national institutional accrediting agency for Bible colleges and universities.

The Alabama State Department of Education licenses Heritage Christian University as a private university. 

The United States Office of Education Register lists the university, making Heritage Christian University students eligible for grants and federal loans. 

The Alabama State Approving Agency recognizes Heritage Christian University for educational benefits to veterans. 

Heritage Christian University meets the U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization's requirements for eligibility to enroll foreign students.

 Library 

The Overton Memorial Library services the undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty and staff. The library was dedicated in November 1986 in honor of Basil and Margie Overton and in memory of their son Timothy, who died in 1974. Library holdings exceed 107,000 volumes. 

In October 2005, the McMeans Family Reading Area was created in honor of William Delona and Othella Tuten McMeans. The Heritage Marriage and Family Resource Center was created within OML in April 2006 through a grant from the Alabama Marriage and Family Project. In June 2008, the Bagents Family Resource Center was created, honoring the Bagents Family.

The library hosts the Charles Coil Colloquium each spring semester. The lecture, in memory of HCU’s founding president Charles Coil, is “designed to enrich the intellectual climate of Heritage Christian University, its constituency, and the great academic community.” Dr. Frederick William Danker, Professor Emeritus of New Testament, Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, spoke at the inaugural lecture in 2010. Dr. Richard Bauckham, a Senior Scholar at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, spoke at the second Coil Lecture. In 2013, Dr. Thomas Long was the third Coil Colloquium speaker. The Fourth Annual Charles Coil Colloquium is scheduled for Friday, April 4, 2014, and Dr. Ralph Klein is scheduled to speak.
