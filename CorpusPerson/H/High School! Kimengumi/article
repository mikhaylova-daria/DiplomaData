is a manga series written by Motoei Shinzawa which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1982 to 1987. The title literally translates to High School! Funny-face Club or High School! Weird Face Club. An anime TV series (1985–1987) and movie (1986) based on the series were also released. The High School! manga series was preceded by (1980–1982), and followed by (2001–2005).

Kimengumi is an episodic chronicle of the bizarre adventures of a group of misfit junior high school (and later, high school) boys who form a club known as the "Kimengumi". All of the character names in the series are puns. For example, "Kawa Yui" is another way of saying "kawaii", and "Uru Chie" is a slang form of "urusai", meaning "obnoxious" or "annoying".

Other romanizations of the title include High School! Kimen-gumi and Highschool! Kimengumi. In a 2006 survey of celebrities by TV Asahi, Kimengumi was listed as #87 on a list of the top 100 favorite anime series.
