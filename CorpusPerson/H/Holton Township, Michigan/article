Communities
*Brunswick is a small unincorporated community in section 13 of the township at on M-120 at the eastern boundary with section 18 of Sheridan Township in Newaygo County. It was founded about 1875 as the point where the stage coach road met the Pere Marquette Railway line between Muskegon and White Cloud. Passengers and mail were taken north from here to Hesperia. The settlement was first called "County Line" and later "Marionville", after the first postmaster, Isaac Marion. However, the post office, established May 1881, was called "Dash." It was renamed Brunswick, Muskegon County in September 1897 and transferred to Newaygo County in April 1943. Originally there was a feed store in the community for farmers, and in the rear of that building there was a small post office. Both have since closed, and it is now served by the post office in neighboring Holton. St. Michaels Catholic Church and cemetery are located there. The community is located at the end of Brunswick Road. While the CSX rail line still runs through the town, train station has closed.
*Holton is a small unincorporated community at the corners of sections 22, 23, 26 and 27 of the township at about 15 miles northeast of Muskegon and about 15 miles east of Lake Michigan. Holton was platted in 1871 and named for Henry H. Holt, a Muskegon County delegate to the State Constitutional Convention of 1867 and later Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, 1873-76. He donated the bell to the local Methodist Church. A post office was established in February 1872.

 Education 
In 2000, Holton was one of only seven school districts in the state of Michigan that would have been eligible for private school vouchers, on which there was a state-wide referendum that year. Most residents were opposed to the measure, since they did not want competition for the local public school. The measure was defeated in Holton and across the state by about a 2:1 ratio.

The main festival of the year, Holton Days, is held in the last weekend of July.

The Holton Red Devils have a state title in volleyball in 1994. They were also runner-up in 1993. In baseball they were state runner-up in 2006, losing to #1 state ranked Homer 3-2.
