I Like It When You Die is the fourth album by American grindcore band Anal Cunt. It was released on February 11, 1997, on Earache Records as MOSH 169CD. It contains 52 songs, with the average track length well under a minute.

I Like It When You Die was the first album with the new line-up of Seth Putnam, Josh Martin, and Nate Linehan. It was recorded in 1996 at Headroom Studios, just before the band's 1996 tour with Mortician and Incantation.

The album was originally titled You're Gay, and the album cover was going to contain a mirror, but this idea was later changed. Instead, the record features a lot of songs with the word "gay" in the title, as well as various insults. One song on the album provoked an official complaint, "You Went to See Dishwalla and Everclear (You're Gay)", about which the label American Records complained.

Putnam stated in interview that this was his favorite Anal Cunt album. The album debuted at #12 on the CMJ Radio Trade Magazine Loud Chart, and peaked at #10.

Kyle Severn, from the band Incantation, makes a guest appearance playing drums on the track "Kyle from Incantation Has a Mustache".
