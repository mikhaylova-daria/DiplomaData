Its members include Marques "Batman" Houston (born August 4, 1981), Jerome "Romeo" Jones (born October 25, 1981), and Kelton "LDB" Kessee (born January 27, 1981), all natives of Los Angeles, California, where the group was formed.

The group also branched out into film (such as House Party 3 & House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute) and television (such as A Different World, Sister, Sister, Family Matters and All That) before disbanding in 2002. In 2010, Houston announced on 106 & Park that the group were planning to record another group album together for 2011. A new album is currently in the works titled "Forever Immature". It was scheduled to be released in Summer 2013, along with a tour, however, a release has yet to be given for the project. On November 6, 2013, Immature performed their first show since reuniting at Club Nokia in Los Angeles, CA with Next and Dru Hill.

Biography
Immature was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1992 by Marques "Batman" Houston, Jerome "Romeo" Jones and Don "Half-Pint" Santos. Kelton "LDB" Kessee (the group's drummer) joined the group in 1993 replacing Santos due to his parents pulling him from the group. In 1999 the group would change their name to IMx, feeling Immature no longer reflected the band.

After IMx
In 2002, the group disbanded. Houston and Jones (under the name Young Rome) began solo careers, while Kessee continued his work as a record producer. Houston became the first former member to release a solo album, MH, in 2003. Jones followed suit with the release of his debut solo album in 2004, entitled Food for Thought. Houston later released four additional albums: Naked (2005) Veteran (2007) Mr. Houston (2009) and Mattress Music (2010).

Houston and Jones have also pursued acting careers, with both starring in the dance film, You Got Served (2004). Houston co-starred on Fat Albert (2004) and starred in UPN's comedy Cuts. He also starred in the horror film Somebody Help Me. He appeared as Roger on the show Sister, Sister (1994–1998). Santos recently got married
