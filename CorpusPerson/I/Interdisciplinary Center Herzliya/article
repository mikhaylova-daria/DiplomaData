History
The campus is located in Herzliya, six miles north of Tel Aviv, on the grounds of a former Israeli Air Force base.

The first class at IDC Herzliya consisted of 360 students. Over the years, leading professors from Israel and the US have joined the faculty, additional schools have been opened and the student body has grown to 6,500. IDC Herzliya was founded on the belief that an independent nonprofit university unfettered by bureaucracy and an external agenda could make a significant contribution to Israeli society and its future leadership. IDC offers innovative interdisciplinary degree programs that employ advanced information technology while providing a solid understanding of the region and its geopolitical relevance in the world.

The IDC Herzliya motto is “Liberty and Responsibility." The school logo is based on the flag that Theodor Herzl, the father of modern Zionism, proposed for the Jewish state.

In 2012, Israel Chemicals helped to found the School of Sustainability, which will focus on environmentally conscious business development and entrepreneurship. Graduates will be awarded a BA in sustainability studies.
