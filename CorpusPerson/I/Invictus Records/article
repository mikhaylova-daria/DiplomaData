Invictus Records was an American record label based in Detroit, Michigan, created by former top Motown producers Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland, Jr., (known collectively as Holland–Dozier–Holland). It was the sister label to the Buddah-distributed Hot Wax Records, which was also owned by Holland-Dozier-Holland.

History
For most of the 1960s until 1967, Holland-Dozier-Holland (H-D-H) were a leading songwriting and production team, providing major hits for The Supremes, The Four Tops and other Motown acts. However, they decided to quit the company they had helped to establish and start their own label for better control and greater rewards. They eventually launched Invictus, along with Hot Wax Records, in 1969. Their most successful acts on Invictus were Freda Payne and Chairmen of the Board; they also released Parliament's first album, Osmium. The label was distributed by Capitol Records from 1969 to 1972 and then by Columbia Records from 1973 onwards.

In September 1970, the British music magazine NME reported that Invictus had the UK's top two singles. Freda Payne's "Band of Gold" was #1, while Chairmen of the Board's "Give Me Just a Little More Time" was at #2 in the UK Singles Chart. Both of those records were million-sellers in the US, but neither topped the pop or R&B charts. Invictus had two other gold records: Freda Payne's "Bring The Boys Home" and 8th Day's "She's Not Just Another Woman", both in 1971.

On leaving Motown, H-D-H were subject to legal action by Berry Gordy and, as a result, they were temporarily barred from issuing new compositions on their labels. Consequently, the names Holland-Dozier-Holland were not used until after 1970; releases were initially credited to Ronald Dunbar (one of their producers) and "Edythe Wayne", which was a pseudonym.

The Invictus label was light blue with black printing. A statue of a seated man (Auguste Rodin's "The Thinker") almost covers the entire label, with "INVICTUS" in dark blue at the top and to the left of the center hole. There are a group of black and white rays coming from the eye of the statue and extending downward to the right.

The trio launched a third label, Music Merchant through Buddah Records in 1972 and signings included former Motowner Brenda Holloway, The Jones Girls and Eloise Laws, but the label had no commercial success with over a dozen releases and was closed the following year.

In 1973, when Hot Wax folded due to cash flow problems from royalty payment issues, Dozier left to forge a solo career and the Holland brothers moved their remaining artists to Invictus. The label continued to operate on a reduced level until 1977, when it also folded and was eventually remodeled to HDH Records.

Dozier and the Holland brothers still own the catalogue, which is managed by HDH Records.
