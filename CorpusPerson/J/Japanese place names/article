Japanese place names include names for geographic features, present and former administrative divisions, transportation facilities such as railroad stations, and historic sites in Japan. The article Japanese addressing system contains related information on postal addresses.

Administrative level
Most place names are suffixed with its administrative division. These suffixes are often dropped in common usage when no ambiguation is likely. The suffixes are as follows:

* -ken (県) for a prefecture; e.g., Yamanashi-ken
* -to (都, lit. "capital"), prefecture-level region name unique to the capital Tōkyō-to
* -fu (府, lit. "office" or "area"), prefecture-level region (sometimes translated "urban prefecture") named so for historical reasons. There are now only two: Ōsaka-fu and Kyōto-fu. Tokyo-to was also classified as this before being reorganized.
* dō (道), an "administrative circuit", a semi-archaic administrative division formerly widespread. Modern usage is limited to Hokkaido, but terms like Tōkaidō (southern portion of eastern Japan) remains in common informal usage.

Because of the above four suffixes, the prefectures of Japan are commonly referred to as todōfuken (都道府県). And below the level of prefectures, there are:

* -gun (郡), a district, usually rural. The Japanese postal service and many other sources translate this as county.
* -shi (市), a city
* -ku (区), a ward of a city; e.g., Naka-ku in Hiroshima. The 23 special wards of Tokyo are separate local governments nearly equivalent to cities.
* -machi or -chō (町), a town - this can be a local government or a non-governmental division of a larger city
* -mura or -son (村), a village; e.g., Kamikuishiki-mura - this can also be a local government or a nongovernmental division of a larger city or town

Direction
Some names contain a word indicating a direction:
* chūō (中央) or naka- (中) - central; e.g., Yokosuka Chūō; Naka-Okachimachi
* higashi (東) - east
* kita (北) - north; e.g., Kita-ku, literally meaning North Ward
* minami (南) - south
* nishi (西) - west
* u (右) ("right") and sa (左) ("left"), directions relative to the Kyōto Imperial Palace (and from the viewpoint of the Emperor, who faces south, so that sa is east and u is west): Sakyō-ku, Ukyō-ku

Relationship
Other names contain a word indicating the relationship of a settlement to another of the same or a similar name:
* hon or moto (本) - the original; e.g., Fuchu Honmachi; Moto Hachiōji
* shin (新) - new

Geographic features
Geographic features figure prominently in Japanese place names. Some examples are
* hama (浜) for a beach; e.g. Hamamatsu
* hantō (半島) for a peninsula; e.g., Izu Hanto
* ishi (石) or iwa (岩) for a rock; e.g., Ishikawa Prefecture; Iwate Prefecture
* izumi (泉) for a spring; e.g., Hiraizumi, Iwate
* kaikyō (海峡) for a strait; e.g., Bungo kaikyō
* kawa or -gawa (川 or 河) for a river; e.g., Asakawa
* ko (湖) for a lake; e.g., Biwa-ko, Kizaki-ko
* nada (灘) for a sea
* oka (岡) for a hill; e.g., Fukuoka
* saki (崎) or misaki (岬) for a promontory; e.g., Miyazaki city
* san or -zan (山) or yama for a mountain; e.g., Yamanashi Prefecture, Aso-san
* sawa or -zawa (沢) for a swamp; e.g., Mizusawa, Iwate
* shima or -jima (島) or tō for an island; e.g., Ie-shima, Iwo Jima, Okinawa Honto
* tani or -dani (谷) for a valley
* wan (湾) for a headland or bay; e.g., Sagami-wan

Natural world
Other words that express the natural world or agriculture often appear in place names:
* ki or -gi (木) for a tree; e.g., Tochigi Prefecture
* matsu (松) for a pine tree; e.g. Takamatsu
* mori (森) for a forest; e.g., Aomori Prefecture
* sugi (杉) for a sugi tree; e.g., Suginami
* ta or -da (田) for a rice paddy; e.g. Ōda

Former provinces
Names and parts of names of former provinces appear in many modern place names:
* Yamato: Yamato-Koriyama, a city in Nara Prefecture
* Hitachi: naka, a city in Ibaraki Prefecture
* Sagami River in Kanagawa Prefecture
* Tango: Tango Peninsula in Kyoto
* Chūetsu, part of Niigata Prefecture and location of the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake: its name incorporates a kanji from Echigo Province (as do many other place names in the region)

Medieval Japan
Medieval Japan had many towns that fell into three categories: castle towns, post towns, harbor towns. In addition, the rise of commerce contributed to some place names. Here are some parts of names connected with medieval Japan:
* ichi (市), a market; e.g., Yokkaichi: "fourth-day market"
* -jō (城), a castle. Place names giving directions relative to a castle, such as Jōhoku (North of the Castle), Jōsai (West of the Castle) or Jōnan (South of the Castle), are common throughout Japan.
* minato (港) for a harbor; e.g., Minato
* shuku or -juku (宿), a post or station town on a traditional highway; e.g., Shinjuku

Hokkaido
Many names in Hokkaido originated from words in the Ainu language, as people from mainland Japan conquered and colonized Hokkaido in the Edo period and the Meiji period. Examples of geographic features are -nai and -betsu meaning "river", as in the names Wakkanai and Noboribetsu. The name Esashi comes from the Ainu word esaushi, meaning "cape." Some other names come from places in other parts of Japan because in the past people migrated as a group to Hokkaido, and they give the new settlement a name reminiscent of their old home. Examples include Hiroshima and Date, Hokkaido.

During the rule of the Shoguns (1185-1867), families of samurai often adopted place names as their surnames. Examples are the Ashikaga clan and the Taira clan.

Okinawa
Place names in Okinawa Prefecture are drawn from the traditional Ryukyuan languages. Many place names use the unique languages names, while other place names have both a method of reading the name in Japanese and a way to read the name in one of the traditional local languages. The capital city Naha is Naafa in the Okinawan language. Uruma, which was incorporated in 2005, comes from an old name for the Okinawa Island meaning "coral island" and its name is written in hiragana rather than kanji. In Okinawan, nishi meant "north" rather than "west" as it does in standard Japanese, so Nishihara means "northern field" in respect to its position from the old Ryūkyū Kingdom capital at Shuri; in contrast, the Okinawan word for "west" is iri, which appears in the name of Iriomote-jima. Gusuku (城) meaning "castle" is also common in place names in Okinawa, found in Tomigusuku, Nakagusuku, and Kitanakagusuku, among others. Both Chatan and Yomitan turn tani (谷, "valley") into tan; Chatan also turns kita (北) into "cha" through the Okinawan language.
