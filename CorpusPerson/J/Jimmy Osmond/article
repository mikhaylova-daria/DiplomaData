Early life, career, work with The Osmonds
Osmond was born in Canoga Park, California, the ninth and last child of Olive May (née Davis) and George Virl Osmond. He is the youngest of his siblings and a member of their musical group, the Osmonds. His siblings are Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, and Marie Osmond. He is also the only Osmond of the nine not to have been born in the family's hometown of Ogden, Utah.

At the age of five, Jimmy was the first to be awarded a gold record in the Osmond name. It was for a song he recorded in Japanese, “My Little Darling”.

He remains the youngest performer to have a No. 1 single in the UK Singles Chart, with "Long Haired Lover from Liverpool" in 1972. The song was credited to Little Jimmy Osmond.

As a solo artist, Jimmy has accumulated six gold records, one platinum record, and two gold albums and is in the “Guinness Book Of World Records”, as the youngest artist to have a number 1 record on the UK charts. In addition, Jimmy and his siblings have sold more than 100 million records and share 51 gold and platinum recordings along with numerous other awards and honors, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Career in Latin America
In 1985, he met Latino empresario Manuel Montoya at A&M Records and this led to his only Spanish recording entitled "Siempre Tu", with duets by the iconic Pedro Vargas, on "Otoño y Primavera", written by Luis Angel, and young Latino superstar Yuri on "Dos En Uno", written by Rodolfo Castillo and KC Porter, produced by Jose Quintana and Stephen Tavani and with many other participants such as Albert Hammond, KC Porter, Luis Angel, Lara y Monarrez, Abraham Laboriel, Robert Lamb, Steve Deutch, Linda "Peaches" Green, Carlos Rios,Juan Carlos Calderon and Benny Faccone.

With his personal manager, Manuel Montoya, Jimmy toured Latin US markets, including Puerto Rico, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile. The recording was critically acclaimed and well accepted by the Latin market . The collaboration by Pedro Vargas was Mr. Vargas' last recording before his death at the age of 82 years old.

 Personal life

Stroke
In 2004, Osmond was in Missouri recording his TV show, Jimmy Osmond's American Jukebox, when he was suddenly overcome with a blinding headache. 'It came on so fast and I could hardly see - it was as if I had tunnel vision,' he recalls. 'Somehow, I managed to get to the end of the show. How I drove home I have no idea and I should not have done it because I couldn't even see the lines in the middle of the road, but I was desperate to get back to my family and go to bed. 'The following morning I tried to get up, but felt so dizzy that I fell over. My vision was still bad and this terrible headache was gnawing away right at the base of my skull.' 
 
Jimmy thought it was a severe migraine. But wife Michelle drove him to the local hospital where doctors advised him to have a CT (brain) scan. The tests revealed he had suffered a stroke, but it caused no permanent damage.
