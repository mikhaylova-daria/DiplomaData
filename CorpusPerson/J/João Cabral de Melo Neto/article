João Cabral de Melo Neto (9 January 1920 – 9 October 1999) was a Brazilian poet and diplomat. He is considered one of the greatest Brazilian poets of all time and was awarded the 1990 Camões Prize, the greatest prize in Portuguese language and the 1992 Neustadt International Prize for Literature.

 Life 
Melo Neto was born in Recife, Pernambuco, and died in Rio de Janeiro, and worked as a diplomat for most of his life. He occupied the 37th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1968 until his death in 1999. He is often quoted as saying "I try not to perfume the flower". His works are said to be dry, devoid of the exaggerated emotions that are usually associated with poetry, sticking instead to images, actions and physical descriptions rather than feelings. The image of an engineer designing a building is often used to describe his poetry. It usually follows a strict meter and assonant rhymes.

His poetry, ranging from a tendency to surrealist folk poetry, but characterized by esthetic rigor with a confessional poems averse and marked by the use of rhymes, inaugurated a new form of poetry in Brazil. Brother of the historian Evaldo Cabral de Melo and cousin of the poet Manuel Bandeira and the sociologist Gilberto Freyre, Cabral was a friend of the painter Joan Miró and the poet Joan Brossa. A member of the Pernambuco Academy of Arts and the Brazilian Academy of Letters, he was awarded several literary prizes. When he died in 1999, it was speculated that he was a strong contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
 
He was married to Stella Maria Barbosa de Oliveira, with whom he had the children Rodrigo, Inez, Luiz, Isabel and João. His second marriage was in 1986, to the poet Marly de Oliveira.

Poetry

In the poetry of Cabral, antithetical dualities adorned with baroque are worked to exhaustion: between time and space, inside and outside, massive and non-massive, male and female, northeast and Andalusian fertile semidesert, or Savanna and Pernambucan humid desert. It is a poetry that causes some shock in one who expects an poetry of emotions because his work is basically cerebral and "sensationalist," seeking a purely objective constructive and communicative poetry.
 
Although there is a tendency in his surrealist poems, especially in the initial, as in Stone Sleep, seeking a poetry that was also significant, Melo Neto need not resort to pathos ("passion") to create a poetic atmosphere. Avoiding any romantic tendencies, he seeks an elaborate construction of language and thought and said of his poetry, turning the whole image perception in something concrete and related to the senses, especially to the touch, as can be seen well in a single-blade knife. In this poem, Cabral presents the image of the knife cutting through the feeling of emptiness that makes it seem as if a knife is cutting into flesh.
 
Some words that are often used in his poetry are: sugar cane, stone, bone, skeleton, tooth-edged, razor, knife, scythe, blade, cut, skinned, bay watch, dry, mineral, desert, aseptic, empty, hungry. Things sound and tactile sensations: a poetry of concrete.

He was rejected several times for the Nobel Prize for Literature (which until now has never been given to a Brazilian). He received numerous awards in Brazil and abroad, always leaving their mark, and he was a great inspiration for the concrete poetry movement in Brazil and the world.

Works
Melo Neto's most famous poems are:

*"Morte e Vida Severina" (translated in part by Elizabeth Bishop as "The Death and Life of Severino"), his most famous work, is a very long narrative poem (in most editions over 80 pages long) that describes the life of a poor rural man in the dry northeastern part of Brazil.
*"Uma Faca só Lâmina" (A Knife All Blade) is also considered to be one of his best works, and was translated to English in 1980. The poem is about the many ways to describe "that sorrowful absence in a man".
*"Cão sem Plumas" (A Dog Without Feathers) describes the Capibaribe River of Pernambuco and the poverty-stricken community that surrounds it.
His poetic works, a trend that goes to the surrealist poetry popular, are characterized by aesthetic rigor, with poems averse to confessionalism and marked by the use of toantes rhymes, inaugurated a new form of poetry in Brazil.
