KFSN-TV, channel 30, is an ABC owned-and-operated television station located in Fresno, California, USA. The station is owned by ABC Owned Television Stations, a unit of the Disney-ABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company. KFSN-TV maintains studio and office facilities located on G Street in downtown Fresno; its transmitter is located on Bear Mountain, near Meadow Lakes, California.

History
After the Federal Communications Commission's four-year-long freeze on awarding television station licenses was lifted in 1952, two radio stations – KARM (1430 AM, now KYNO) and KFRE (940 AM, now KFIG) competed for the construction permit to operate a station on channel 12, the sole VHF allocation given to Fresno. KFRE won the permit, and the station first signed on the air on May 10, 1956 as KFRE-TV. It is the third-oldest television station in the Fresno market and upon signing on, KFRE-TV took the CBS affiliation from KJEO (channel 47, now KGPE).

The KFRE stations were acquired by Triangle Publications in 1959. On February 17, 1961, KFRE-TV reluctantly moved to UHF channel 30 to make Fresno an all-UHF market under orders from the FCC. In was known by the term deintermixture, the move was made for the purpose of leveling the playing field and eliminating the potential of unfair competition between the VHF and UHF bands. A similar situation occurred in nearby Bakersfield where that city's lone VHF station, KERO-TV on channel 10, moved to UHF channel 23 in 1963. The move of KFRE-TV to channel 30 opened up channel 12 for use by KCOY-TV in Santa Maria, which went on the air in 1964.

Triangle began its exit from broadcasting in 1971, and sold the KFRE stations to Capital Cities Communications. The new owners sold off the AM and FM radio stations as a condition of the purchase and kept the television station, changing its call letters to KFSN-TV in April 1971 (the KFRE-TV calls are now used on Fresno's CW affiliate on channel 59; that station is unrelated to the current KFSN-TV).

On March 18, 1985, Capital Cities announced it would purchase ABC. Nearly six months later, on September 9, 1985, KFSN-TV traded network affiliations with KJEO and became an ABC affiliate. The transaction was finalized on January 3, 1986, making channel 30 an ABC owned-and-operated station. In 1996, the Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC.

Digital channels
The station's digital channel is multiplexed: Channel Video Aspect PSIP Short Name Programming 30.1 720p 16:9 KFSN-HD Main KFSN-TV programming / ABC 30.2 KFSN-LW Live Well Network 30.3 480i 4:3 KFSN-AW

On April 27, 2009, KFSN began carrying Live Well Network on a new second digital subchannel digital subchannel; a standard definition simulcast is carried on digital subchannel 30.3. KFSN-TV serves as the production facility for two programs seen on the Live Well Network, Motion and My Family Recipe Rocks.

Analog-to-digital conversion
KFSN-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, at noon on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 9 to UHF channel 30.

News operation
KFSN-TV presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6½ hours on weekdays and 3½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among the broadcast television stations in the Fresno market. Unlike most ABC affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone, the station does not broadcast a 5:30 p.m. newscast on weekdays, opting to fill the half-hour with ABC World News . In addition, the station produces the public affairs program Valley Focus, which airs Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m.

KFSN has dominated the local news ratings in the San Joaquin Valley for decades, dating back to its pre-ABC-merger years as a CBS affiliate. Its 5 p.m. newscast, Live at Five frequently attracts more viewers than all other area stations combined. The station's newscasts are not branded Eyewitness News, nor does it use the Gari Media Group-composed "Eyewitness News" music package, like most of ABC's other owned-and-operated stations. Instead, KFSN retains the Action News branding made famous at Philadelphia sister station WPVI-TV, when the format debuted on that station in 1970. Since 1994, KFSN has used the original version of 615 Music's "News One" music package, also used at the time by San Francisco sister station, KGO-TV.

In 2003, the station began pooling resources with sister stations KABC-TV in Los Angeles and KGO-TV to hire a full-time reporter and photographer to staff a Sacramento bureau following Arnold Schwarzenegger's election as Governor during the 2003 California recall election; the Sacrameno bureau was shut down in September 2013. On April 23, 2007, beginning with the 5 p.m. newscast, KFSN-TV became the seventh ABC owned-and-operated station to begin broadcasting their local newscasts in high definition (following its sister stations KABC-TV, WPVI-TV, WABC-TV in New York City, WLS-TV in Chicago, KGO-TV in San Francisco and KTRK-TV in Houston) and updated its news branding to ABC 30 Action News HD. 

On September 12, 2011, KFSN launched an hour-long 4:00 p.m. newscast, which replaced The Oprah Winfrey Show. This follows the trend of the four other sister stations (WABC-TV, WPVI-TV, WTVD and KGO) that started their own 4:00 p.m. newscast after Oprah ended its syndication run. On January 7, 2013, KFSN began producing a half-hour 10:00 p.m. newscast for MyNetworkTV affiliate KAIL-TV (channel 7); the program, titled ABC 30 Action News Live at 10:00, is the fourth such newscast produced by an ABC-owned station through a news share agreement with another local station (alongside Raleigh's WTVD (which produces a 10:00 p.m. newscast for CW affiliate WLFL), San Francisco's KGO-TV (which produces a 9:00 p.m. newscast for independent station KOFY-TV) and Philadelphia's WPVI-TV (which produces a 10:00 p.m. newscast for MyNetworkTV affiliate WPHL-TV); Los Angeles sister station KABC-TV has since begun producing an 7:00 p.m. newscast for independent station KDOC-TV).
