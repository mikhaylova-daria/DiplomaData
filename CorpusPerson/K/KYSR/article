KYSR (98.7 FM, "ALT 98.7") is a commercial alternative rock radio station licensed to Los Angeles, California, serving the Greater Los Angeles Area. Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., KYSR is the Los Angeles affiliate for Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx and the home of morning drive program The Woody Show. The KYSR studios are located in Burbank, while the station transmitter resides in Beverly Hills. In addition to a standard analog transmission, KYSR broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. KYSR also extends its signal by using a single full-power repeater: KSRY (103.1 FM) in Tehachapi.

History
The station currently known as KYSR signed on May 27, 1948 using the KMGM call letters, taken from the station's original owner, the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. The KCBH call letters followed on June 30, 1954.

In 1971, the station callsign changed to KJOK. In 1972, the station callsign changed to KJOI. The station would air a beautiful music format well through the 1980s. Over the years the station was owned by Viacom.

In 1989, KJOI increased the number of vocalists from four per hour to half and half. The older traditional vocalists were replaced with more adult contemporary artists. The instrumentals were dropped altogether in 1990, leading to an evolution to a soft adult contemporary music format. The station also became known as "Touch 98.7", which had placed itself between smooth jazz KTWV and adult contemporary KOST.

In 1990, the call letters were changed to KXEZ. Although the call letters changed, the station retained its soft adult contemporary format.

In late 1992, KXEZ became "Star 98.7". The new call letters were KYSR, which are currently used. In the beginning, KYSR aired an adult contemporary music format which evolved into a hot adult contemporary music format by 1993.

In 1995, most of the rhythmic Top 40 and soft rock tunes were dropped from the playlist and replaced with a lighter modern rock sound, minus the harder approach embraced by KROQ-FM.

Viacom sold the station to Chancellor Media in 1997. AMFM Inc. was formed after Chancellor Media merged with Capstar in 1999. And in 2000, AMFM Inc. merged with current owner, Clear Channel Communications. Coincidentally, around this time Viacom became the owners of KROQ-FM when that station's parent company, CBS, merged with Viacom.

In 2002, KYSR began to experience a decreased market share noted in its declining ratings, which was also likely contributed to by a decrease in the amount of hit music product in the modern adult contemporary genre at the time. The debut of KCBS-FM in 2005 may also be a factor as KCBS-FM airs an adult hits music format that shared a large proportion of music on the KYSR playlist.

KYSR adjusted their playlist in September 2005 to focus on 1980s and 1990s hot adult contemporary music. The playlist adjustment was directed by KHHT program director Mike Marino. By April 2006, KYSR readopted the modern adult contemporary music format with the tag line of "Today's Music Alternative", playing more alternative rock hits. Marino has since relinquished his duties at KYSR to solely focus on KHHT.

All on air personalities including the notable morning show - Jamie, Jack, and Stench - were temporarily pulled off the station. Fans of the Jamie, Jack, and Stench show protested this move which included a public protest at the studio. Shortly afterwards, a poll was established on the website asking if they wanted Jamie, Jack and Stench to return. Ninety-seven percent said yes, and a week later, they returned. However, not soon after the return, JJ&S got replaced by the morning team of "Valentine and Lisa Foxx" in 2007.

On September 20, 2007, KYSR repositioned itself as '98-7.' The Star name was deemphasised as the station moved in a male friendly direction. While the format claimed itself as Modern AC, its musical lean favored Modern Rock/Alternative hits with an updated library of alternative hits from the 80s, 90s and early 2000s such as Nirvana, Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Third Eye Blind and R.E.M.. In addition, KYSR played more new modern rock hits from bands such as The Killers, Foo Fighters, Incubus and Linkin Park. This repositioning came three days after sister station KBIG added more recent adult hits and dropped the dance/disco hits and became known as "104.3 MyFM." Effective September 24, 2007, Valentine took over the KBIG morning show, replacing Charlie Tuna, whose last show was September 17.

ALT 98.7
The station changed from Modern AC to Alternative in 2008 to compete with cross town rival KROQ-FM. Rumors also stated that the change was due to the format change at sister station KBIG to Hot AC and the wariness about KDLD on the airwaves. (KDLD left the airwaves a year after the station flipped to alternative). The station also changed formats to compete better with cross-rival KROQ-FM. The station's logo consists of the numerals 98 and 7 in Gothic typeface with a metallic star between the numerals. Members of "The List" collect points to use towards online/on-air prizes.

In 2008, both R&R/Nielsen BDS and Mediabase added KYSR as an alternative (modern rock) reporter, in part due to its conversion to a modern rock direction.

KYSR also simulcasts on HD Radio. KYSR-HD2 formerly broadcast an adult alternative format called "eRockster", a national online music and social networking portal, syndicated FM radio show and HD side channel radio station that offers listeners the unique opportunity to participate in building and programming the radio station. Currently, KYSR-HD2 airs an active rock format via Premium Choice under the brand "Rock Nation".

On August 9, 2013, the station rebranded as ALT 98.7, with no other change to the format.

Effective April 21, 2014, "The Woody Show" will be heard on ALT 98.7. The morning program will reunite Jeff "Woody" Fife, Renay Ravey, Greg Gory and Menace, who last worked together in 2009 at KITS in San Francisco.
