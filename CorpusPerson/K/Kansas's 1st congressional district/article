Kansas's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Kansas. Commonly known as "The Big First," the district encompasses 63 counties in western and northern Kansas (more than half of the state), making it the 12th largest congressional district in the nation. Located within the district are Manhattan, Salina, Dodge City, Emporia, Garden City, Hays and Hutchinson. The district is currently represented by Republican Tim Huelskamp who was originally elected in 2010 to succeed fellow Republican Jerry Moran who ran successfully for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by now Governor Sam Brownback. 

A characteristically rural district, the 1st is one of the most conservative districts in the nation. Republicans dominate every level of government, often winning by well over 70 percent of the vote on the occasions they face any opposition at all. Spilling across two time zones and parts of three television markets, it extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences. However, due to its size, its congressman is usually reckoned as a statewide political figure, with a very good chance of winning statewide office in the future. Three of the district's four congressmen preceding current representative Tim Huelskamp ascended to the Senate – Moran, Bob Dole and Pat Roberts.

History
Kansas had a single representative in the U.S. House of Representatives until after the 1870 U.S. Census, which showed that the state was entitled to three members of the lower branch of the national legislature. In 1872 three representatives-at-large were elected, but by the act of March 2, 1874, the legislature divided the state into three districts. The 1st Congressional District was composed of the counties of Leavenworth, Doniphan, Brown, Nemaha, Marshall, Washington, Republic, Jewell, Smith, Phillips, Norton, Graham, Rooks, Osborne, Mitchell, Cloud, Clay, Ottawa, Ellis, Ellsworth, Russell, Saline, Dickinson, Lincoln, Riley, Pottawatomie, Jackson, Jefferson, Atchison, Davis (Geary), "and all that territory lying north of the second standard parallel."

No changes were made in until after the 1880 U.S. census, which gave the state seven representatives. On March 5, 1883, Governor George Washington Glick approved an act of the legislature which reduced the 1st Congressional District to only include the counties of Nemaha, Brown, Doniphan, Pottawatomie, Jackson, Atchison, Jefferson and Leavenworth. The apportionment was amended by the act of March 13, 1897, which placed Shawnee County in the 1st Congressional District and Pottawatomie County in the 4th Congressional District.

Although the 1890 U.S. Census showed the population of Kansas to be large enough to entitle the state to eight representatives, no additional district was created until 1905. By the act of March 9, 1905, the state was divided into eight districts with the 1st Congressional District being composed of the counties of Nemaha, Brown, Doniphan, Jackson, Atchison, Jefferson, Leavenworth and Shawnee.

The state's current districting dates from the 1990 U.S. Census, when Kansas was reduced from five districts to four. The 1st District has continued to grow in size since that time, due to the state's population shifts to the eastern side of the state bordering Missouri. The current borders were established in 2012 by a panel of three federal judges, after the Kansas Legislature failed to pass new district maps.
