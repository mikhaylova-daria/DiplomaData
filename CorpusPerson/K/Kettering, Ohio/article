History
The area where the city of Kettering now lies was settled from the late 1700s to the mid-1800s, largely as farmland. The population in the area started to grow, prompting the creation of (now defunct) Van Buren Township in 1841. In November 1952, township voters approved incorporating as the Village of Kettering. (In 1953, the western portion of the village voted to secede, forming a new township, which is now the City of Moraine). By 1955, the village's population had grown to 38,118, which qualified it to claim city status, with the official proclamation by the state on June 24. The city is named for inventor Charles F. Kettering, who resided here in his home, Ridgeleigh Terrace, from 1914 until his death in 1958. Charles Kettering is known for his numerous inventions and contributions to the Dayton area.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, Kettering's population continued to grow, adding more than 30,000 residents. This growth was due in part to the many people who started migrating out of nearby Dayton after World War II. Since the 1980s, Kettering has seen a slow decline in population because of an aging population and loss of manufacturing jobs.

In recent times, new businesses have been attracted to the city's several business parks. Reynolds and Reynolds built a major complex a few years ago adjacent to the 1250-acre Miami Valley Research Park, which houses AFIT, Booz Allen Hamilton, BWI Group, Strategic Leadership Association, and Wright State University Center for Global Health Systems & Management. In 2011, Community Tissue Services broke ground on a new complex. Kettering is also a major economic force in the area and is home to several large employers. The city’s top five employers are Kettering Medical Center, Tenneco, Reynolds and Reynolds, GE Money (a division of General Electric), and Victoria’s Secret Direct.
