Kevin Brady Dillon (born August 19, 1965) is an American actor best known as Drama on the HBO dramedy Entourage and as Bunny in the Academy Award winning war film Platoon. He was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his performance on Entourage.

 Early life 
Dillon was born in New Rochelle, New York, the son of Mary Ellen, a homemaker, and Paul Dillon, a portrait painter sales manager, and golf coach at Fordham University. He is the younger brother of actor Matt Dillon. Both brothers attended Mamaroneck High School.

 Career 
Dillon began acting in both television and films in the 1980s and first received wide attention for his role as the psychopathic soldier Bunny in the 1986 film Platoon. In 1983, Dillon played Arnold Norberry in the TV Movie No Big Deal. In 1988, he portrayed Brian Flagg in a remake of the 1958 American science fiction film The Blob. The remake flopped, earning only 8.2 million against a budget of 19 million, although in recent years it has gained a devoted cult following. Other notable film roles from that period included War Party (1988), No Escape (1994), and The Doors (1991), in which he played drummer John Densmore.

Much of Dillon's 2000s work has been in television, including the CBS series That's Life as Paul DeLucca and the Fox series 24 as Lonnie McRae. He appeared in the 2006 film Poseidon, a remake of the The Poseidon Adventure. He appeared on Donald J. Trump's Fabulous World of Golf on The Golf Channel in April 2010.

Dillon was on the HBO hit comedy series Entourage playing Johnny "Drama" Chase, for which he received a 2007, 2008, and 2009 Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe nomination in 2008. The show completed its final season on Sunday 9/11/2011.

He appeared in the CBS comedy How to Be a Gentleman, but the planned series was cancelled after two episodes.

 Personal life 
On April 21, 2006, Dillon married model/actress Jane Stuart in Las Vegas. Entourage cast member Jerry Ferrara was the best man at the wedding and Kevin Connolly walked Stuart down the aisle after Dillon shouted "Victory!" (a tribute to his character's work on the metafictional TV series Viking Quest). In May 2006, Jane gave birth to their daughter, Ava, in Los Angeles. He has a daughter, Amy, from a previous relationship. Dillon currently resides in New York City.
