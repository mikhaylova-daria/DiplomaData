Cristian Alberto 'Kily' González Peret (born 4 August 1974) is an Argentine retired footballer who played mainly as a left winger.

He started his career with Rosario Central which he would represent in three different spells, moving to Spain in 1996 where he appeared for Zaragoza and Valencia, amassing La Liga totals of 182 games and 23 goals over the course of seven seasons and winning the national championship with the latter. He also spent three years in Italy with Inter Milan.

González's career in the Argentine national team lasted for ten years, in which he was selected for the 2002 World Cup and two Copa América tournaments.

Club career

Early years
Born in Rosario, Santa Fe, González started playing with local Rosario Central, making his Argentine Primera División debut on 18 December 1993 in a 0–2 away loss against Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata.

After two years he moved to Boca Juniors, spending the 1995–96 season with the club and playing alongside Diego Maradona.

Spain
In 1996 González transferred to Real Zaragoza. He appeared in his first game in La Liga on 8 September by playing 19 minutes in a 2–1 win at Sevilla FC and, during his three-year spell in Aragon, shared teams with countryman Gustavo López who was also a winger.

Subsequently González joined fellow league club Valencia CF for 1.300.000 pesetas, being teammate to also Argentines Pablo Aimar and Roberto Ayala for several seasons and contributing with 31 matches and two goals in the 2001–02 campaign as his team won the league title after a 31-year wait. Following the emergence of younger Vicente he became surplus to requirements – only 13 appearances and 546 minutes of action in his last year, which also included a run-in with manager Rafael Benítez– and left the Che as a free agent; additionally, he amassed UEFA Champions League combined totals of 31 games and five goals as the side reached the final in 2000 and 2001, and was granted Spanish nationality in early January 2001.

Inter
In the 2003 summer, González followed Valencia coach Héctor Cuper to F.C. Internazionale Milano, and again shared teams with several compatriots.

He was used mainly as a substitute during his tenure, playing 75 official contests and failing to find the net.

Return home
Aged 32, González returned to his country and Rosario Central, going on to still be an important first-team member during three top flight seasons. On 4 August 2009, he joined San Lorenzo de Almagro who was managed by former national teammate Diego Simeone; however, after the former's relegation, he decided to rejoin for a third spell and help in the Primera B Nacional campaign, following which he retired at 37.

International career
An international since 1995, González represented the Argentine national team 56 times, scoring 9 goals between 1995-2005; he made his international debut on 8 November 1995, in a 1-0 home defeat to rivals Brazil. He was selected for manager Marcelo Bielsa's 1999 Copa América Argentine squad, where he scored a goal in Argentina's 2-0 group stage win over Uruguay, as they went on to reach the quarter finals, only to be eliminated by the eventual champions Brazil. With Argentina, under Bielsa, he became a regular member of the starting eleven, and he also participated in the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, starting against England (and being replaced), also appearing against Nigeria and Sweden in an eventual group stage exit in the tournament.

Two years later, again under Marcelo Bielsa, he was selected for the 2004 Summer Olympics tournament as one of three overaged players. He featured in all games and scored in the opener against Serbia (6–0), helping the Albiceleste win gold in Athens. 

González also took part in the 2004 Copa América with Argentina. He scored three goals in the tournament; his first two came in the group stage in Argentina's victories against Ecuador and Uruguay. His third came from a penalty in regulation time in the final against rivals Brazil. Argentina were eventually defeated in the resulting penalty shootout, following a 2-2 draw, although González was once again able to net his penalty in the shootout.

Style of play
Kily González was a quick, dynamic, and versatile midfielder, who was capable of playing both as a winger and as an attacking midfielder. His main attributes were his technical ability, his powerful and accurate striking ability from distance, and his determination.
