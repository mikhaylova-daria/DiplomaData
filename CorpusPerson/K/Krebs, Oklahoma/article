Attractions
Krebs is famous throughout Oklahoma for its many Italian restaurants. Isle of Capri, "Pete's Place", and Roseanna's have been active for generations. Authentic Italian fare available in Krebs that is lacking in chain restaurants includes "Lamb Fries" (fried sheep testicles). Pete's Place is now a licensed brewery and markets its "Choc" (short for Choctaw) beer, as well as several other varieties, statewide. Perhaps even more widely known is "Lovera’s Family Grocery", a small, authentic Italian market famous throughout the state and beyond for their lightly smoked sausage and handmade caciocavallo cheese. The city of Krebs maintains a city park which includes a nice baseball park, a one kilometer walking track, picnic facilities, a two-story replica of the gazebo that originally stood in the town square, and will soon include playground equipment. The park stands on a portion of the old fairground/racetrack site of a hundred years ago. The original racetrack was a 1/8 mile banked oval track where horses, sulkys, and early autos were raced. The Krebs Italian Band played many festivals or 'festas' at the park in bygone simpler times. For years during the 1990s "The Ethnic Festival" was a popular attraction on Labor Day weekend taking place on this Historical Site. Games such as Bocce Ball and Morra were played by all for fun. Also taking place at this location was The Terrapin Derby, originated in 1929 when Mayor J.T. Sadler visited the Miller Brothers Shows in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Mayor Sadler brought the idea back to Krebs as a fundraising idea. The Derby was a success and enough money was raised to purchase a new truck for the city. Over the years the derby raised funds that provided vehicles and equipment for one of the finest volunteer fire departments in the region. Krebs had an Italian Band that played in a double-decker bandstand in downtown Krebs. There were at least five bandstands between McAlester and Hartshorne that the band played at on weekends providing entertainment for families from all over. Lots of families rode the street car to these sites for picnics and festivals. Krebs had 5 different newspapers at different times: Krebs Eagle, Krebs Cyclone, Krebs Banner, Krebs Advertiser, and The Oklahoma Miner. The Krebs Opera House was re-built as a brick structure in 1903 after the first one was destroyed by fire the previous year and it and the St. Joseph's Catholic Church were the first brick buildings to go up in Krebs. It was the only place for miles around that featured stage shows. Many fine road shows played here and moving pictures were shown in the Opera House, also. The Dreamland Theater later became the popular movie theater in Krebs and it was owned and operated by Mr. & Mrs. David Holstead. Krebs also features prominently in Elmore Leonard's 1930's gangster novel, "The Hot Kid."
