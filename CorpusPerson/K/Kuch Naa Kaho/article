Kuch Naa Kaho (Hindi: कुछ ना कहो, translation: Don't Say Anything) is a 2003 Bollywood romantic drama film, directed by Rohan Sippy, starring Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Arbaaz Khan. It was released on 5 September 2003.

Plot

Happy American bachelor Raj (Abhishek Bachchan) reluctantly attends his cousin's wedding in Mumbai where he finds himself pushed towards marriage by his overzealous uncle (Satish Shah). His uncle's employee, Namrata (Aishwarya Rai), begrudgingly chaperones Raj on a series of set-ups that he deliberately sabotages. Eventually on one of these dates, Raj watches Namrata dancing and realises he loves her. He finally gets the strength to tell her, but to his surprise he discovers she has a 9- or 10-year old son, Aditya, and is already married.

Raj is confused, but forms a strong fatherly relationship with her son anyway. His uncle informs him that Namrata's husband disappeared right before Aditya's birth; although Namrata is still technically married, Raj takes heart. Soon enough, however, she finds out about Raj's feelings. In turmoil, she attempts to distance herself from him, knowing they can never be together. Nevertheless, Raj follows her to Aditya's boarding school, having promised the boy to pose as his father. While Raj drives Namrata home, he sarcastically comments that her circumstances must have been her fault. Upset, she tells Raj that her husband was the one that left her for another woman whilst she was pregnant. Eventually Namrata comes round and they both get together.

Raj is about to introduce Namrata to his mother, but just as she is about to leave for the party her husband Sanjeev (Arbaaz Khan) walks back into her life to begin where they left off - but first, admitting he and his mistress have been engaged in criminal activity since his departure. Namrata does not want anything to do with him, but she is powerless to make him leave, even though she is now in love with Raj. After a chance meeting with Sanjeev, Raj invites Sanjeev to his cousin's wedding. Adi also comes and goes straight to Raj and calls him "Dad." Sanjeev, jealous and angry, insults Raj and his family and creates a scene at the wedding. Namrata finally gets the courage to tell Sanjeev publicly that she deplores his abandonment of her and the child, his irresponsible and immoral acts, considers herself no longer his wife, and that she is in love with Raj. Raj and Namrata get married, have a child and live happily ever after.
