History

Kyushu University was initially founded as Fukuoka Medical College in 1903 and was associated with Kyoto Imperial University. Kyushu Imperial University was established as a separate entity in 1911. In 1947, Kyushu Imperial University was renamed Kyushu University.

On October, 2003, Kyushu University and Kyūshū Institute of Design was officially amalgamated into a single university, with Kyushu Institute of Design becoming Kyushu University's Ohashi Campus. In 2004 Kyushu University was incorporated as a national university corporation under a new law which applies to all national universities.

War crimes

In World War II, the survivors of a B-29 bomber on the border between Kumamoto and Ōita were sent to Kyushu Imperial University where they were vivisected and killed. In 2008, the medical school had a keynote speech led by Dr. Toshio Tono on bioethics and the atrocities. Tono is a graduate of Kyushu University who was among those who were present during the experiments, with many of the events he later detailed in his book Disgrace: The Truth behind the Vivisection at Kyushu University.

 Symbol 
Kyushu University does not have an official school song, instead it has one cheering song and three student songs including Matssubara-ni, with lyrics by Yoshifumi Akiyama.

The University's logo features a background of pine needles inset with an older iterance of the kanji for "university". The logo was officially established in 2004, but was originally proposed by student Sou Yoshihide in the mid 20th century, and was used then on from 1950. There have also been alternatives designs, such as those featuring the Japanese KU or Q, for Kyushu instead of "university". 

The school color is wine, and there are some other associated colors.
