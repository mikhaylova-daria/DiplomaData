Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Inc. (ΛΘΑ), established in 1975, is the first sorority ever created to cater towards the needs of Latinas in the United States.

The idea for Lambda Theta Alpha began in the 1970s, when colleges and universities experienced an influx of Latino enrollment; the organization was founded at Kean University by seventeen women of Latin, Caribbean, and European descent. The sorority is Latin by tradition, not by definition in that it remains open to women of all races and ethnicities. It is a social organization that stresses social justice and activism.

Lambda Theta Alpha partakes in traditions such as having hand signs, and calls, as well as saluting and strolling but not stepping, out of respect to the Divine Nine. Saluting demonstrates unity and respect. While strolling demonstrates unity and pride. All these traditions are extremely respected and held dearly by the organization.

They also fall under the umbrella of NALFO, which is the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations. Lambda Theta Alpha has won recognition as the Sorority of the Year award from 2000-2001, 2002-2003, 2003–2004, 2009-2010, 2011-2012, 2012–2013 and 2013-2014.

Founding Mothers
Our seventeen Founding Mothers came together and stayed together by choice in an effort to create the first Latin Sorority in the nation. The Founding Mothers are more than historical icons to the sisterhood, they are distinguished professionals within their fields and they continue to contribute to their respective communities on the social, political, and educational level.

National philanthropy
Lambda Theta Alpha members serve thousands of hours each year to a variety of philanthropic causes and needs. In the effort to create a more united and bigger impact nationally, Lambda Theta Alpha selected a national philanthropy. In January 2010, LTA became an official collegiate partner to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, becoming the first individual Latino Greek organization to commit fully to the hospital's efforts. With this partnership, LTA provides resources of community service and activism and more importantly, another direct link to the Hispanic community for St. Jude. LTA has pledged to raise awareness about childhood cancer and St. Jude in the Latin community, as well as fundraise for the hospital through a variety of events and programs.
