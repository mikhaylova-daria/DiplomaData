The Painting Phoenix Arise and the Mandala-DNA - Double Helix Effect
Phoenix Arise is a 5x7ft. oil painting that McCloskey completed after four years in 1997. The image of his Phoenix Arise painting was printed as post cards in 2003. Accidental dropping of the cards led to a discovery that when the painting is mirrored with itself a DNA double helix image appears. This discovery led to another that revealed the Phoenix Arise cards also create mandala-medicine wheels when they are formed into a circle. The first three Phoenix Arise mandalas McCloskey discovered revealed visually the mythic story of the Phoenix Bird of Immortality and Rebirth, in card form. The first Phoenix Arise mandala creates a nest, the second mandala shows the nest erupting into flames, the third mandala reveals the flames transforming into a blossom.

*Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones selected images from McCloskey’s hand-painted Grimoire (fr: book of spells) for the Stones’ Bigger Bang Tour (August 2005 to August 2007). The images were projected onto enormous screens on the stage where the group performed. The Grimoire was originally created for the movie, Shadow of the Vampire. 
*In 2010, Flying Lotus (Steve Ellison) selected works from McCloskey’s illuminated books, the Codex Tor, as the album art of Cosmogramma.
