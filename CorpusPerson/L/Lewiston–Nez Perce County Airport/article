 History 
The airport began as a Chamber of Commerce project in 1931, and the original runway was paved in 1942. Jet service arrived in October 1969 after the completion of the runway 8/26.

Lewiston was served by West Coast Airlines Fairchild F-27s during the 1960s. West Coast merged with Bonanza Air Lines and Pacific Air Lines to form Air West in 1968, (renamed "Hughes Air West" in 1970, "Hughes Airwest" in 1971) and based in San Francisco.

The early jet service was by Air West Douglas DC-9s and BAC One-Elevens of Cascade Airways, supplemented with turboprops of both airlines. Hughes was bought by Republic Airlines of Minneapolis in October 1980, which cut back flights in Idaho and the western U.S. Republic's final flight to Lewiston was in September 1982, and ended its southern Idaho and eastern Washington service shortly after in April 1983. Cascade, based in Spokane, ceased operations in 1986.

The short-lived Gem State Airlines of Coeur d'Alene served Lewiston for 11 months, until November 1979. Mountain West Airlines of Boise served Lewiston for less than three months before folding in early March 1981. Big Sky Airlines of Billings briefly served Lewiston in 1979.

The municipal golf course adjacent to the west, Bryden Canyon, was designed and built in the early 1970s, and opened in March 1975.
