History
Isaac Palmer founded the village of Lodi in 1846 in what was then the Pleasant Valley Precinct of the Wisconsin Territory. Palmer chose this glaciated valley as the location for the Village of Lodi because of its water power potential. Spring Creek powered a sawmill that year and a grist mill followed in 1850.

Susie the Duck
Lodi's nickname is Home of Susie the Duck, and Susie has been the town's official mascot since 1948. Where Spring Creek crosses Main Street (Wis. Hwy 113) in downtown Lodi, there is a small creek-side park where visitors can buy dried corn from vending machines to feed the often present wild ducks. In this area is a small stone basket, inscribed with the name of former Lodi resident Engle Knerzer, and every year, invariably, a duck builds a nest there. When the first mallard settled in that location in 1948, it was nicknamed "Susie" by Jean Kasuboski (née: Breunig) the granddaughter of the police chief William Breunig.

Every year there is a "Susie the Duck Day" celebration, the highlight of which is the rubber duck race. Participants pay $5 for a small rubber duck. The thousands of ducks are then dumped into the creek where they "race" toward a finish line and prizes are awarded based on order of finish. This day is also an important parade day with many activities in Goeres Park, brat stands on Main Street and in Goeres Park, and a beer garden in the park.

Ice Age Trail
The Ice Age National Scenic Trail, a hiking trail, follows 1,000+ miles along the terminal moraine formed in the last ice age which ended about 10,000 years ago. A portion of this trail runs through Lodi. The trail begins in Potawatomi State Park in Door County. It then winds south through the state to Janesville, then back north through Lodi, ending at the Dalles of the St. Croix River in Polk County. Geologic features along the route include drumlins, kames, lakes, ice-walled lake plains, tunnel channels, outwash plains, and eskers.

The Ice Age National Scenic Trail is administered by the National Park Service, with assistance from non-profit volunteer organizations. Lodi's chapter of the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation maintains an office in downtown Lodi, with access to the trail several hundred yards away. The longest section of the trail in the area is about 6.2 miles. It begins at the Robertson Trailhead, south of Lodi on Lodi-Springfield Road off of Hwy. 60 West.

Several other segments of the trail are located in or near Lodi, including a 1.3-mile segment on the corner of Lovering and Highway J and a 21-mile section north of the Colsac III Ferry on Lake Wisconsin.
