Los Alamitos High School (also known as Los Al) is a public school for grades 9 to 12 located in Los Alamitos, California, and also serving the city of Seal Beach and the community of Rossmoor. It is the only traditional high school in the Los Alamitos Unified School District; the far smaller Laurel High School serves as a continuation school and as the district office site. Both Oak Middle School and McAuliffe Middle School feed into Los Alamitos High.

History
In its very first year, classes were held at Pine Junior High School (now McAuliffe Middle), and only sophomores attended. The following year saw the school move into its new campus whose buildings were specifically designed for Los Al's unique flexible scheduling program (and the addition of juniors, followed by seniors the next year). During its first two years, Los Alamitos High School had a complete flexible schedule program. Student submitted hand-written multi-part daily schedules during their scheduling class. This allowed them to choose from scheduled sessions of their classes for flexible periods of time, depending on the needs of the teachers and students. In the third year, it changed to a computer scheduling program to provide more administrative accountability for the students' whereabouts. This version of flexible scheduling used then-current computer technology to generate daily class schedules based on each instructor's lesson plans. Students would report each morning to their "scheduling class" to receive their daily schedule – broken into a series of "modules". Each teacher would select the needed number of fifteen-minute modules to allow for that day's instruction, whether it be a test, a lecture, a lab, etc. In their scheduling class, students could rearrange or fill open modules from the "October" schedule, a listing of available classes. This allowed serious students to make the best use of their schedule to attend classes in a sequence that made more sense for that day.

Los Al's unique flexible scheduling was replaced with a traditional school schedule in 1977 after it was discovered that less disciplined students were abusing the system. For those more dedicated students who leveraged the school's unique scheduling to their advantage, Los Al produced an extraordinary number of early graduates, who went on to succeed in the best universities.

Beginning in fall 1987, the Orange County High School of the Arts was resident on its campus, but its success and growth led it to move to a bigger campus in Santa Ana in 2001.
