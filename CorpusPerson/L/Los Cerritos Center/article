History
The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency initially invested $30 million for the development of the Los Cerritos Center area. The shopping area built at Gridley Road and South Street was developed by Ernest M. Hahn, Inc. in September 1971 with the Phase I opening of the corridor from The Broadway department store (currently Macy's) to Ohrbach's (currently a Forever 21) in addition to having an initial 150 sThe Macerich Companypecialty stores. Phase II followed in 1971 with the opening of the wing from Ohrbach's to Sears. In 1981, Phase III saw the opening of Nordstrom and its first wing. In November 1993, Phase IV was completed when the Palm Court Cafes debuted in the Center with 14 eateries.

At its opening, the Los Cerritos Center was one of the area's first shopping malls and was noted for its high quality maintenance and complete climate-controlled environment.

The original goal of the center was to bring thousands of dollars of sales tax revenue to the city of Cerritos. In its first four years, the city of Cerritos' retail sales grew tenfold, topping over $207 million in 1974.

Today
The most recent design was completed in 2010 and includes three main corridors with some extensions. Skylights were added to take advantage of the Southern California sunshine, and marble and stone were added to the walkways, along with seating and landscaping. The Macy's wing houses merchandise, confectionary, and services for the family, the main concourse holds more upscale fashion stores, restaurants and boutiques, and the Sears wing focuses on specialty shops in entertainment, younger consumers, as well as the Palms Court Cafe food court.

Forever 21, which opened in January 2010, was the first flagship styled store for the retailer in the United States and opened to much acclaim. 

A Nordstrom department store and wing opened May 2010 on the site of a former Robinsons-May. The added wing made room for nine additional in-line shops and restaurants. The old Nordstrom site is now vacant and was used as a dinosaur exhibition in March 2014.

Realizing the importance of multiculturalism and diversity in the region today, the Los Cerritos Center, in conjunction with the city of Cerritos, is home to the Festival of Friendship held every February. Cultural booths and performances are held annually with the goal of reaching out to the various diverse communities the center serves.

The daily average attendance from January through November 2010 was 22,133 people a day. December 2010 saw an average of 35,631 a day.
