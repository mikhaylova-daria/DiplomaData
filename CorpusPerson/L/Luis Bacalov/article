Bacalov has composed significant works for chorus and orchestra. Presently he is the artistic director of the Orchestra della Magna Grecia in Taranto, Italy.

Life and career
Luis Bacalov was born in Buenos Aires, of partial Bulgarian origin: his grandparents were Banat Bulgarians who emigrated to Argentina and their familiar tradition is Jewish. Early on in his career, he composed scores for Spaghetti Western films, including Django, Storm Rider and The Price of Power.

Bacalov has been nominated twice for Academy Award for Original Score—music adaptation or treatment— in 1967 for The Gospel According to St. Matthew, and winning the award for Il Postino in 1996.

In the early 1970s, he collaborated with Italian progressive rock bands such as New Trolls, on their 1971 album, Concerto grosso per i New Trolls, Osanna, on the band's second album, Preludio Tema Variazioni e Canzona releaased in 1972, and Il Rovescio della Medaglia for the 1973 release of their third album, Contaminazione.

Bacalov has also composed significant works for chorus and orchestra, including his Misa Tango (1997), a work setting a Spanish-language adaptation of the classic liturgical Mass to the tango rhythms of his native Argentina. The standard Mass text has been significantly truncated in accordance with Bacalov's desire that the work appeal to those of all Abrahamic faiths: Christians, Muslims and Jews. All references to Christ — except for the Lamb of God — have been deleted. Credo, the third and longest text part of a sung Mass, has been reduced to most of its first strophe and part of the second one: "" (" I believe in one God, ... Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth") plus "Amen" at the end. Misa Tango debuted in Rome with Plácido Domingo as solo tenor in 2000 and was later recorded by Deutsche Grammophon with Plácido Domingo (tenor), Ana María Martínez (mezzo-soprano) and Héctor Ulises Passarella (bandoneón).

Bacalov composed Cantones de Nuestro Tiempos (Psalms for our Times: The Cambridge Psalms) (2006), a commissioned work with text from the Psalms of David for baritone and soprano soloists, orchestra and chorus, which had its world premiere at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in spring 2006 by the www.cambridgechorus.org/aboutCCC.html Cambridge Community Chorus (William E. Thomas, Music Director). This followed the May 19, 2002 U.S. premiere performance of "Misa Tango" also at Harvard University's Sanders Theatre (William E. Thomas, Music Director).

Two of his songs, "The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)" and "Summertime Killer", were used in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill. Tarantino also chose three Bacalov songs for his movie, Django Unchained: Django, His Name Was King, and La Corsa (2nd Version).

Bacalov was the first to write a triple-concerto for bandoneón, piano, soprano and symphony orchestra: Tango Music with Symphonic Proportions.

Presently (in 2014) he is the principal director of www.orchestramagnagrecia.it/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id11&Itemid33&lang=it Orchestra della Magna Grecia in Taranto, southern Italy.
