 Marathon City Branch Library 
A well-stocked lending library, accessible to everybody, was maintained at the Friendship House prior to the 1950s. The Friendship House was operated by a religious order and was located on County Road NN just to the east of the village.

The Marathon City Library began in 1954 in a space at the Marathon High School. In 1973, the Marathon City Library became a Branch of the Marathon County Public Library when the Wausau Public Library and Marathon County Library merged.

By 1975, the library was relocated to the village hall, and later moved to a storefront location on Main Street. Construction of a new village hall in 1985 included the branch library, where it resided until 2010.

In late 2009, after it was decided more space was needed for books, computers and special programs, a referendum vote allowed the village to plan construction of a separate library building on Washington Street. This building project was completed in September 2010.
