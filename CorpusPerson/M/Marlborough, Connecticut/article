History

The beginnings of the town can be traced back to the opening of Sadler's Ordinary in 1648—which is still in business today. Formerly a crossroads of sorts, travelers would stop to rest at the heart of what is now Marlborough center during colonial times, and eventually a petition was filed to the colonial government to form an Ecclesiastical Society in 1747. Marlborough was incorporated on 13 October 1803 with land from parts of three neighboring towns: Glastonbury, Colchester (New London County) and Hebron (Tolland County).
