The town of Massena contains village also named Massena. The town and its village are named after André Masséna, a general and Marshal of France during the Napoleonic Wars.

 History 

The town was first settled circa 1792 by French lumberjacks. Unlike much of northern New York, Massena was not completely in the Macomb's Purchase. Massena was one of the first towns of the county and was incorporated with the county in 1802. The town is named after one of Napoleon's field marshals, André Masséna, who commanded around that time. 

The town suffered natural disasters in 1944 (earthquake) and in 1998 (ice storm).

 Economy 
The economy of early Massena was partly based on health spas, but the modern town is involved in power production, aluminum production at ALCOA and the commerce of the St. Lawrence Seaway.

Massena is home to an Alcoa Aluminum plant, the longest continually operating aluminum facility in the world, and a former Reynolds Metals Company plant, now called Alcoa East (temporarily idled in July 2009). Alcoa currently employs over 1100 people at its facilities in Massena, making it one of the largest private employers in New York north of Syracuse, contributing over $340 million annually to the area's economy. 

Massena is also home to a former General Motors aluminum engine-casting plant which was closed in 2008, laying off or relocating over 500 employees.
 The New York Power Authority also operates a hydroelectric power generating dam, the St. Lawrence-FDR Power Project, on the St. Lawrence River adjacent to Massena. Curran Renewable Energy manufactures wood pellet fuel and mulch in the town.

Massena is also home to the Eisenhower Locks, part of the St. Lawrence Seaway which allows ships and vessels to pass through the St. Lawrence River and onto the Great Lakes.

Massena's economy has contracted in recent years due to shifts in the manufacturing economy. The town has recently made attempts to diversify its economy by promoting a mixture of high tech industries, retail industries and tourism based on its location on the St. Lawrence River and proximity to the Adirondack mountains.
