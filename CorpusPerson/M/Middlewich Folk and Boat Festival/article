The Middlewich Folk and Boat Festival takes place in June in Middlewich, Cheshire, England. The festival builds on the towns industrial heritage in which canal boats were used to move coal and other raw materials in the town for the production of salt, and then move the salt out of town, either for use directly, or as a raw material in the manufacture of chemicals such as Chlorine and soda ash.

The Middlewich Folk and Boat festival is now firmly established on the folk circuit and it is estimated that 30,000 people visit the town during the festival weekend, along with 400 boats. The festival was originally organised by members of the Middlewich Paddies, and taken over by the local council in 2011 when the original committee were unable to continue with the event. In 2008, the festival was declared among the top three folk festivals in England by Guardian Online.

History
The festival has been held since 1990. It was cancelled in 2001 because of Foot and Mouth disease.

The festival
Since 1990 there has been an annual folk music and (canal) boat festival, which is now highly regarded on the folk circuit with visitors coming into the town from all over the UK. During this festival artists appear at venues throughout the town, whilst Morris Dancing and Craft Stalls also featured. The boating festival centres on the Trent and Mersey Canal. The main venues where people and boats converge are the Big Lock and Kings Lock, public houses next to locks of the same name on the Trent and Mersey canal.
