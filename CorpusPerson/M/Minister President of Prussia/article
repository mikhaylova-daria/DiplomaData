The office of Minister President , or Prime Minister, of Prussia existed in one form or another from 1702 until the dissolution of Prussia in 1947.

When Prussia was an independent kingdom (since 1701), the Minister President functioned as the King's chief minister and presided over the Prussian Landtag (the Prussian legislature established in 1848). After the unification of Germany in 1871 and until the collapse in 1918, the office of the Prussian Minister President was usually held jointly by the Imperial Chancellor, beginning with the tenure of Otto von Bismarck.

Under the Weimar Republic the Minister President was the head of the state government in a more traditional parliamentary role. The office ceased to have any real meaning except as a kind of political patronage title after the Nazi dismantlement of Prussia as a state in 1935, and disappeared along with Prussia itself after World War II.
