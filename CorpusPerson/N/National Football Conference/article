The National Football Conference (NFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL). This conference and its counterpart, the American Football Conference (AFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL. The current NFC title holder is the Seattle Seahawks.

Current teams
Since 2002, the NFC has 16 teams, organized into four divisions each with four teams: East, North, South, and West.

Season structure


Each NFC team will play the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the NFC West will have played against every team in the AFC East and NFC North. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents - the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the top six teams in the conference will proceed into the playoff. These teams will consist of the four division winners and the top two wild card teams. The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game with the winner receiving the George Halas Trophy. The NFC Champion will then play the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl.

History
Both the AFC and NFC were created after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. When the AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, the NFL consisted of 13 clubs. By 1969, the AFL had expanded to ten teams and NFL to 16 clubs. In order to balance the merged league, all ten of the former AFL teams along with the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Colts formed the AFC, while the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC. 

However, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to align the clubs in the NFC. The alignment proposals were narrowed down to five finalists, and then the plan that was eventually selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle's secretary, on January 16, 1970.

The five alignment plans for the NFC in 1970 were as follows, with Plan 3 eventually selected:

*Plan 1
**Eastern - Atlanta, Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington
**Central - Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, New Orleans
**Western - Dallas, Los Angeles Rams, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco
*Plan 2
**Eastern - Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington
**Central - Atlanta, Dallas, New Orleans, St. Louis Cardinals
**Western - Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Los Angeles Rams, San Francisco 
*Plan 3
**Eastern - Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington
**Central - Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota
**Western - Atlanta, Los Angeles Rams, New Orleans, San Francisco
*Plan 4
**Eastern - Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington
**Central - Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay
**Western - Dallas, New Orleans, Los Angeles Rams, San Francisco 
*Plan 5
**Eastern - Detroit, Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington 
**Central - Chicago, Dallas, Green Bay, St. Louis Cardinals
**Western - Atlanta, Los Angeles Rams, New Orleans, San Francisco

Three expansion teams have joined the NFC since the merger, thus making the current total 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995.

Parity is generally greater among NFC teams than AFC teams. The only NFC team that has never made a Super Bowl appearance is the Detroit Lions. Since the 2002 realignment, no NFC team has made back-to-back Super Bowl appearances, until the Seattle Seahawks in 2015. And between 2000 and 2013, the NFC has sent 11 different teams to the Super Bowl, whereas the AFC had sent only six: the Baltimore Ravens (2 times), the Denver Broncos (1 time), the Indianapolis Colts (2 times), the Oakland Raiders (1 time), the New England Patriots (5 times), and the Pittsburgh Steelers (3 times).

Logo
The original NFC logo, in use from 1970â€“2009, depicted a blue 'N' with three stars across it. The three stars represented the three divisions that were used from 1970-2001 (Eastern, Central and Western). The 2010 NFL season brought an updated NFC logo. Largely similar to the old logo, the new logo has a fourth star, representing the four divisions that have composed the NFC since 2002.
