History
Ndejje University was established in 1992 under the Name and Style of "The Christian University of East Africa" under the pioneer-ship and ownership of Professor Reverend Doctor Sams Kironde Kigozi. In 1994 it was represented in Ontario and Quebec Inter-Faculty agreements with 12 Canadian and 8 American universities by Simon Peter Kabala-Kasirye, a trainee Academic Registrar. The objective was to persuade each of the twenty North American universities to send their students to TCUEA for one Semester each year, and spend the second semester at their home campus in Canada or USA. Simon Peter Kabala-Kasirye was self-sponsored, with partial assistance from the International League for People with Intellectual Exceptionality. Dr. Samson Babi Mululu Kisekka, at that time, the Vice Chancellor of the university, wrote an introductory letter for Simon Peter Kabala-Kasirye. With that letter, he was able to solicit and obtain a large collection of books, magazines, computers and software for the new university.

There being no Anglican Faith based university in North America out of the seven that contributed materials to start TCUEA, the conservative Anglican clergy feared that the institution would "highjacked" by the charismatic Christian Churches, proliferating across the Continents at that time. In 1995, the "The Christian University of East Africa" with some government involvement was annexed by the Anglican Diocese of Luweero, in the Province of the Church of Uganda. The name of the university was changed from The Christian University of East Africa, to Ndejje University, without any compensation to the founders. In 1998, the institution received recognition as a tertiary level institution of higher learning by the Uganda Government through the Ministry of Education and Sports. In 2001, Simon Peter Kabala-Kasirye, before returning to Canada, advised the parties involved to foster an interdenominational round table to bolster the North American Interfaculty Scholarships and Academic Exchanges he had pioneered. He argued that with integrity the university could take on a status quo of an academic freedom international learning centre hosted by the Anglican Church in Africa. He further advised that the parties who founded The Christian University of East Africa be compensated, including but not limited to the estate of Professor Reverend Doctor Sams Kironde Kigozi, whose children were still minors.

Ownership of the university was expanded to include all six dioceses of the Church of Uganda in the Buganda Region. Nejje University formerly The Christian University of East Africa, was issued a University Charter by the Government of Uganda in 2009. At the time offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs that are recognized nationally and Internationally.
