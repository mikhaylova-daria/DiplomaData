Club career

Manchester City
Onuoha played regularly for Manchester City's reserves in the 2003–04 season, and had his first involvement with the Manchester City first team in the 2004–05 pre-season, playing in a friendly against Bury. He made his first team debut against Arsenal in the League Cup on 27 October 2004, at the age of 17. He made his Premier League debut as a substitute on 1 November 2004 at home to Norwich City. Though Onuoha's natural position is centre-half, manager Kevin Keegan initially played him at right back with the intention of improving his passing ability. Against Doncaster Rovers in a League Cup match, Onuoha was red carded for the first time in his career, after a collision with Rovers goalkeeper Andy Warrington. The red card was later rescinded however Manchester City went on to lose the game on penalties.

Onuoha made 18 appearances in his debut season, but suffered a series of injuries during the 2005–06 season, meaning he played only 12 games.

Due to injuries to various first choice players during the 2006–07 season, Onuoha enjoyed several long spells in the first team. He soon established himself and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.

He captained the Manchester City side to a 2–1 victory over Bristol City in the League Cup second round. He scored his first goal for City at home against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 March 2008 in a 2–1 win. On 5 April 2008 Onuoha dislocated his shoulder in a game against Chelsea and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2007–08 season following surgery.

The first half of the 2008–09 season was an injury-plagued time for Onuoha, missing most matches, however after City's 3–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup, he started every single game until the end of the season, forming an effective partnership with Richard Dunne in the centre of defence.

On 29 July 2009, Onuoha agreed to a new five-year deal with Manchester City.

Sunderland (loan)
In August 2010, Onuoha joined Sunderland on a season-long loan. He made his Sunderland début on 14 August against Birmingham City at the Stadium of Light. He scored his first goal as the result of a brilliant dribble around three Chelsea defenders for Sunderland in a 3–0 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 14 November 2010.

Queens Park Rangers
On 26 January 2012, Onuoha agreed to a four and a half year deal with Queens Park Rangers, reuniting him with his former manager Mark Hughes.
He scored his first goal for the club on 3 August 2013, against Sheffield Wednesday, in the opening fixture of the 2013–14 season.

International career
Onuoha was a regular in the England U-21 side, making his debut on 12 October 2005. He was part of the squad participating in the 2007 European Under 21s Championship in the Netherlands. During the Championships Onuoha was subjected to racist abuse from Serbian fans, but received praise for maintaining his conduct amid provocation. He was a regular at centre back, partnering Steven Taylor. During the semi-final against the Netherlands, he limped off with an injury and England were down to ten men as all three of the permitted substitutions had been made; they lost 13–12 on penalties. He captained the England Under-21 team for the first time in a 0–0 draw with Poland Under-21s. In the summer of 2009 he took part in the European Championships and played his last match for the U-21's.

In March 2007, Onuoha received an international callup from Nigeria, but has announced he would like to represent England at full international level. However, he has since admitted that he would play at the FIFA World Cup for Nigeria if he were to be called up.
