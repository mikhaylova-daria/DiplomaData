Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP is an international law firm founded in San Francisco, California. Orrick traces its roots back to 1863, making it the oldest continuously operating law firm in San Francisco, and the second-oldest privately held company in San Francisco after Levi Strauss & Co..

The firm has over 1,100 lawyers worldwide in 25 offices, with more than 200 attorneys in each of its two largest offices in San Francisco and New York.

The firm is focused on serving companies in the technology, energy & infrastructure and financial sectors and practices in five core areas: Corporate, Energy & Infrastructure, Finance, Intellectual Property and Litigation.

History
Orrick traces its roots to the year 1863, when the German Savings and Loan Society (which later became part of the First Interstate Bank of California) was organized, with John R. Jarboe as its general counsel. In 1885, Jarboe, along with colleagues Ralph J. Harrison and W.S. Goodfellow, founded the law firm Jarboe, Harrison & Goodfellow.

Jarboe, Harrison & Goodfellow dissolved in 1891 when Harrison was appointed justice to the California Supreme Court. In 1901, Goodfellow formed a new partnership with Charles Eells, creating the firm Goodfellow & Eells. William Horsley Orrick joined the firm in 1910, and after Stanley Moore joined the firm in 1914, the firm's name changed to Goodfellow, Eells, Moore & Orrick.

In 1927, Ralph Palmer, Tom Dahlquist, George Herrington, and Mitchell Neff became partners, and Eric Sutcliffe joined in 1932. During the 1930s the firm played a major role in helping to finance the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. It not only helped structure the bridge's financing, but also defended the bonds' validity when challenged by interests opposed to the bridge's construction.

Sutcliffe replaced Orrick as the firm's managing partner in 1947, a position he held for more than 30 years. In 1980, the firm's name was changed to Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.

Orrick is one of the few California firms to have reached critical mass of over 200 attorneys in New York. Its East Coast ambitions were assisted when it acquired 40 lawyers and their litigation practices from Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine in 1998.

The Global Operations Center (GOC), where the firm's day-to-day administrative operations are centralized, was established in 2002 in Wheeling, West Virginia.

The firm expanded internationally in 2005 at the expense of the now-defunct law firm Coudert Brothers. Orrick doubled its London office with the addition of the Coudert team and opened offices in Moscow, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai with Coudert Brothers professionals. Also in 2005, the firm laid the foundation for its emerging companies practice with the addition of a team from the Venture Law Group (VLG). VLG’s founding partner Don Keller and Orrick’s current chairman Mitch Zuklie joined the firm’s Silicon Valley office.

In 2006, the firm engaged in protracted merger negotiations with legacy Wall Street firm Dewey Ballantine. The merger was unsuccessful and Dewey later combined in 2008 with fellow New York firm LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae to form Dewey & LeBoeuf. The same year, Orrick expanded its Paris office through a combination with Rambaud Martel, a preeminent M&A and dispute resolution firm in France.

In 2008, Orrick has expanded into Germany by combining with Hölters & Elsing (Partnerschaft von Rechtsanwälten), which gave the firm offices in Berlin, Düsseldorf and Frankfurt. Orrick also welcomed a group of project finance attorneys in its San Francisco office from Thelen LLP and in its Paris office from Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle. In 2008, the firm admitted almost two dozen partners in its London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., offices from the San Francisco firm Heller Ehrman, including 27 hired after Heller's Sept. 26, 2008, announcement of dissolution. This move added Orrick’s Supreme Court & Appellate Litigation practice head, Josh Rosenkranz, who was named “Litigatorof the Year” by The American Lawyer in 2012 and successfully argued Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. before the U.S. Supreme Court. The move also added Annette Hurst, who has been named to the Daily Journal’s “Top 75 IP Litigators in California” list (2010-2012).

On Nov. 13, 2008, citing the severity of the global economic downturn, Orrick laid off 40 associates and 35 staffers in various offices, predominately in the United States, and said that because of the economy and the firm's recent capital investments, profits per partner would be down this year. In recent years, Orrick has outperformed other San Francisco-based firms in growth and profitability.

In March 2009, Orrick laid off an additional 100 attorneys and 200 staff, citing again the recession that began in December 2007 as the reason.

In September 2010, Orrick announced it had entered preliminary merger talks with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld But just six days later, the two firms announced the talks had been aborted, making the proposed union the latest in a series of failed merger attempts by Orrick, including dalliances with Coudert Brothers, Cooley, Venture Law Group, Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, Dewey Ballantine and SJ Berwin.

In 2011, Orrick opened an office in Munich and in 2012 expanded again with the addition of Brussels.The firm has also made a number of recent hires out of government: McGregor Scott, former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of California, joined the firm’s Sacramento office in 2009; Rob McKenna, two-term Attorney General for the State of Washington, joined the firm’s Seattle office in 2013; and Bob Loeb, former Acting Deputy Director of the Appellate Staff of the Civil Division at the U.S. Department of Justice, joined the firm’s Washington, D.C. office in 2013.

In Spring 2013, Silicon Valley-based corporate partner Mitchell Zuklie succeeded Ralph Baxter as chairman. Mr. Baxter served as Chairman of Orrick for 22 years and was widely praised as an innovator in the legal profession.
