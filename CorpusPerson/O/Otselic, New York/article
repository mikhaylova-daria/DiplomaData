 Wildlife 
Formerly most of the land was in agriculture, chiefly dairy. Since the end of the nineteenth century, farm abandonment has increased, and today forest cover and early succession forest regrowth dominate the landscape mixed with remaining dairy farms. The forest cover is mixed hardwoods occurring naturally and large plantations of spruce and pine on state-owned lands. White pine was common prior to European settlement, but due to the high demand for its clear, light, easily worked lumber, pine stands were removed during the nineteenth century and today are almost totally absent. Logging has always been an important part of the local economy, utilizing high-value hardwoods for sawlogs as well as firewood and softwood poles and pulp.

Hunting, trapping and wildlife-related recreation such as birdwatching and wildlife viewing are important activities. Common wildlife include white-tailed deer, beaver, mink, muskrat, squirrel, chipmunk, coyote, fox, skunk, raccoon, porcupine, and woodchuck, and less common but increasingly sighted wildlife include bear, otter, fisher, and bobcat. Bird life is varied and rich. Turkey and grouse are plentiful and are popular game birds. During the summer breeding season, the Otselic area has over 100 breeding bird species, one of the highest numbers of breeding bird species in New York state. Bald eagles and osprey are seen regularly along the Otselic River. Ravens are recolonizing the hills, reclaiming their historic range. Red and white crossbills from Canada and Alaska have bred in the large conifer plantations on New York state land.
