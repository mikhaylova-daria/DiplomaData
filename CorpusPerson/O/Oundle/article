Oundle is an ancient market town on the River Nene in Northamptonshire, England, with a population of around 5,800. It is situated north of London and south-west of Peterborough. The nearest railway station is at Corby, west of Oundle.

History
Inhabited since the Iron Age, Oundle was originally a trading place and market for local farmers and craftsmen.

The Saxon invasion saw the arrival of a tribe called Undalas which possibly meant undivided. It is the death place of St Wilfrid in 709AD where he had consecrated a church as well as being the location of one of his monasteries. The current www.oundlestpeters.org.uk/ St Peter's Church occupies the same site as St Wilfrid's original Church.

Saint Cetta or Cett was a seventh century saint and is the Patron Saint of Oundle. Very little is known of him, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript, he was from around 1000AD, buried in the monastery at Oundle near the river Nene, and a chapel to St Cett was built in the eleventh century, on the small knoll beyond the end of St Sythes Lane. The presence of this shrine and the market charter, explain much of the growth of Oundle in the twelfth century.

The Domesday book records Oundle in Polebrook hundred with a population of 36 households, a mill and a value in 1066 of £0.3, which had risen to £11 by 1086.

As the area became prosperous, wealthy traders set up shops and houses, and guilds were formed. Unlike other settlements in the vicinity, Oundle was unaffected by the Black Death in the mid-14th century.

Oundle had a grammar school since at least 1465, at which Sir William Laxton (Lord Mayor of London) was educated. He founded Laxton Grammar School in 1556, administered by the Worshipful Company of Grocers, from which Oundle School evolved.

In 1743 a group of mutineers from the Black Watch were captured at Ladywood, near Oundle. They had deserted in protest at being sent abroad, instead of patrolling the Highlands, for which the regiment had been raised.

Landmarks
Among the oldest buildings is the Talbot Hotel. This was constructed of timber; it was rebuilt with stone from the ruins of nearby Fotheringhay Castle. Other public houses include the Rose & Crown (a 17th Century Inn Haunted by the White Cavalier), the Ship Inn (a 14th-century coaching inn), the Angel, the George and the Riverside, which is currently derelict.

There are a number of churches. By far the most prominent, with the largest steeple in the area, is www.oundlestpeters.org.uk/ St Peter's Church which occupies the main churchyard. There are also Methodist, Baptist and Roman Catholic churches. However, the Baptist church does not have its own building and holds services on Sunday mornings at Prince William School.

Education
Local schools include a comprehensive school, Prince William School, a middle school, Oundle and Kings Cliff Middle School, and www.oundleprimary.com/ Oundle Primary School rated as "Outstanding" in its most recent Ofsted inspection. The town is also the location of Oundle School, a co-educational boarding independent school with around a thousand pupils, most of whom are boarders.

Culture and community
Oundle hosts a number of annual events, notably:
*The Oundle International Festival (OIF) is an annual music festival and pipe organ school, founded in 1985, with the training of young organists as its core. These summer schools are centred on a Frobenius organ in the Oundle School chapel. A concurrent festival programme for the public was also planned as a recurrent feature.
*The Oundle Festival of Literature also takes place annually.

There is also a park with swings and climbing frames, as well as a skatepark which was built in 2005 and regenerated in 2012. An annual fair and circus is located in the park.
