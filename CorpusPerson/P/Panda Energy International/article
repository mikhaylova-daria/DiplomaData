Panda Energy International, Inc. is an American privately held company headquartered in Dallas, Texas which constructs, maintains and operates environmentally friendly power plants.

History
Panda Energy, headquartered in Farmers Branch, Texas (but lists "Dallas" on its site due to a fluke with its ZIP Code) was founded in 1982 and has developed, financed, constructed and operated large-scale energy facilities both domestically and internationally. The company built the two largest gas-fueled merchant electric generation facilities in the United States totaling 4,400 megawatts of generating capacity; was responsible for the first U.S sponsored, internationally financed run-of-the-river hydroelectric project in the state of Nepal; and obtained the first U.S. capital markets financing for construction of a power plant in The Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Altogether, the company has raised over U.S. $5 billion to develop and build more than 9,000 megawatts of generating capacity. 

The Carter family have owned a controlling stake in the company ever since, making Panda Energy a family business.

TNA Entertainment, LLC.

In October 2002, Panda Energy purchased a controlling interest (72%) of the Nashville, Tennessee-based professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from founder and CEO Jerry Jarrett. The seemingly unlikely acquisition came about after TNA publicist Dixie Carter, the daughter of Robert W. Carter, contacted her father and persuaded him to purchase the company (which was facing bankruptcy after a major financial backer, HealthSouth Corporation, withdrew their support).

On October 31, 2002, Panda Energy created the limited liability company TNA Entertainment in order to administer TNA. While Jeff Jarrett, the former President of TNA, was appointed Vice President, the majority of other management positions were filled by former Panda executives. Chris Sobol, the Panda Manager of Business Development, was appointed Vice President of Operations, and Frank Dickerson (and later Kevin Day) was appointed chief executive officer, while Dixie Carter was made President.
