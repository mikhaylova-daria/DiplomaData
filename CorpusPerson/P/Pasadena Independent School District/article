Pasadena Independent School District is a school district that is based in Pasadena, Texas (USA). Dr. Kirk Lewis, was named Superintendent of Schools in 2005.

Pasadena ISD serves much of southeast Harris County. The district includes most of Pasadena, South Houston, a portion of Houston (including Genoa), and portion of Pearland.

Each Pasadena ISD house or residential area is assigned to an elementary school, an intermediate school, and a high school. Some areas are assigned to fifth grade centers. Later Pasadena ISD will build "middle schools" that cover grades 5 and 6.

In 2009, the school district was rated "State Recognized by the Texas Education Agency.

History
According to a report around November 2, 2004 by the Texas Education Agency, among the 30 largest school districts in the state, Pasadena ISD was the 8th-fastest growing district in Texas by population; much of the growth occurred in the "South Belt" area along Beltway 8.

The district was named the National Model School District in 2005 by the International Center for Leadership in Education.

In 2011 voters approved of a new bond which will allow Pasadena ISD to complete building grade 5-6 middle school facilities for all of the district.

School uniforms
All students in Pasadena ISD are required to follow a specific dress code.

All students are required to wear polo shirts or oxford shirts. Students from pre-kindergarten through the eighth grade may wear solid blue or solid white shirts. Each campus may also choose a third solid color for its students to wear, though some choose not to adopt an additional color. Students from the ninth grade through the twelfth grade may wear any solid color.

Students are required to wear khaki or navy blue slacks or khaki or blue denim trousers. Skirts and jumpers are also allowed as long as they are in the same styles as the slacks.

The Texas Education Agency specified that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform; parents must specify "bona fide" reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections.
