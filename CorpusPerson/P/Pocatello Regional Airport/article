History
In 1943, the Pocatello Army Airfield was built as a Second Air Force heavy bomber (B-17, B-24) training base.

In 1949, it became surplus property and was obtained by the city of Pocatello to build a commercial airport.

Western Air Lines served Pocatello for a number of years, but discontinued all service by 1980. According the airline's August 1, 1968 system timetable, Western operated Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops into Pocatello. This Electra service was then replaced with Boeing 737-200 jetliner service with nonstop flights to Salt Lake City, and direct flights to Las Vegas and Los Angeles, according to the airline's September 6, 1973 system timetable. After discontinuing mainline flights, the airline subsequently served the airport as Western Express which was operated as code share service by SkyWest with commuter turboprop aircraft.

In the mid 1980s, Cascade Airways served Pocatello with British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven twin jets, according to the February 15, 1985 edition of the North American Official Airline Guide (OAG). The OAG also lists Cascade flights operated with smaller Fairchild Metro commuter turboprops.

Horizon Air served Pocatello until January 7, 2006, originally with service to Salt Lake City in 1983. The airline canceled that service in favor of flights to Boise starting in 1984 operated with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops

Big Sky Airlines served Pocatello from the day Horizon canceled service until March 30, 2007.
