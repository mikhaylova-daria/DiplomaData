Pomfret School is an independent coeducational boarding and day school in Pomfret, Connecticut, United States for grades 9 through 12 plus a post-graduate year. Pomfret School was founded in 1894, on the principles of intellectual rigor and the development of character. It aims to help students realize their scholarly, financial, physical and spiritual potential and recognize their responsibilities as members of a community. 

The school is located on Connecticut Route 169 and U.S. Route 44 next to The Rectory School in the Pomfret Street Historic District. 

 Facilities 
The campus was designed by landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted in 1894. Architect Ernest Flagg (1857–1946) designed the Romanesque stone Clark Memorial Chapel in 1907, and the distinctive brick Georgian school house, four dormitories, Pyne infirmary, and Lewis gymnasium from 1907 to 1917. The DuPont Library was the gift of Henry B. DuPont; the Centennial Building of 1994 was designed by Mark Simon (class of '64) of Centerbrook Architects. In October 2004, the school opened a new athletic center and student union designed by Tai Soo Kim Partners. The athletic center was donated by Jon Corzine, former governor of New Jersey and parent of a recent Pomfret graduate, and the Student Union was donated by Robert Olmsted, an alumnus and long-time trustee of the school. Other new facilities include the Jahn Rink, designed by architect Helmut Jahn, another parent of a recent graduate; the Blodgett Boathouse and Blodgett Tennis Center, both donated by Mark Blodgett (class of '75); a state-of-the-art observatory; and the Lasell Alumni House. The school also owns a student-run radio station, WBVC (FM) 91.1 FM.
