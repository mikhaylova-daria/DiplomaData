Poyle is a largely industrial and agricultural area in the unitary authority of Slough, England, adjoining the Colne Valley regional park. It is immediately west of the M25 motorway and 18 miles (29 km) west of Charing Cross in London and has junctions to the M25 and M4 motorways at either end of its Colnbrook with Poyle civil parish.

The locality occupies the easternmost spur of Berkshire, before 1995 was part of Stanwell, Surrey and before 1965 was part of Middlesex. The neighbourhood is contiguous with the larger village of Colnbrook (which lies to the north) and is once again considered a sub-locality of a neighbour – many businesses within Poyle's industrial areas use Colnbrook as their address.

History
The village lay within Middlesex since before the Norman Conquest as part of Stanwell, developing a manor in the early Middle Ages. It was in the Staines Urban District from and from 1930 which transferred to Surrey in 1965 on the dissolution of Middlesex County Council. From 1974 it formed part of the borough of Spelthorne. In 1995 due to the barrier presented by the M25 London Orbital Motorway it became, along with Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire, part of the Colnbrook with Poyle parish of the borough of Slough in Berkshire.

The 'village' is contiguous with the larger village of Colnbrook (which lies to the north) and is once again considered a sub-locality of its neighbour – this time many businesses within Poyle's industrial areas use Colnbrook as their address rather than Poyle.

Transport
London Buses route 81, operated by London United, serves Poyle; other bus services are provided by First Berkshire & The Thames Valley.

The Staines & West Drayton Railway was built through Poyle in the 1880s, and at one stage two stations served the area: Poyle for Stanwell Moor Halt, which opened in 1927, and Poyle Estate Halt, which opened in 1954. Both were closed in 1965 when passenger services on the railway were withdrawn, and the track was lifted in 1981 due to the construction of the M25.

Heathrow Airport
Poyle is the location of a major Federal Express (FedEx) sorting office where parcels and letters are processed before being air dispatched to overseas destinations via nearby Heathrow airport. Due to its proximity to Heathrow airport Poyle lies under the flight path of many departing/arriving routes. Poyle Residents Association have long campaigned for restrictions on night flights from Heathrow airport. Along with other local village/town residents' groups they have been involved in second stage consultation talks (during 2005) with the DTI about this problem.
Poyle is also the British location for the Aerospace Fire Protection Company, named Graviner (which was part of Wilkinson Sword) and is now Kidde-Graviner part of the United Technologies
Corporation Group. Poyle is now home to the Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 which is scheduled to open on 31 August 2011 and the Travelodge UK Heathrow Terminal 5.
