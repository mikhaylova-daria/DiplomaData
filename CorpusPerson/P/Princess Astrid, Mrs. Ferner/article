Princess Astrid Maud Ingeborg, Mrs. Ferner (born 12 February 1932, in Oslo, Norway) is the second daughter of King Olav V of Norway (1903–1991) and his wife, Princess Märtha of Sweden (1901–1954). She is the older sister of King Harald V of Norway (born 1937) and younger sister of Princess Ragnhild of Norway (1930–2012).

As she is the great-granddaughter of Edward VII of the United Kingdom, she is in the line of succession to the British throne. She is a second cousin to Elizabeth II and also a maternal first cousin to Baudouin of Belgium and his successor Albert II of Belgium.

Biography
Princess Astrid was christened in the Palace Chapel on 31 March 1932 and her godparents were: her paternal grandparents, King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway; her maternal grandparents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden; her maternal aunt, Princess Astrid of Belgium; Elizabeth, Duchess of York; Princess Thyra of Denmark; Prince Eugen of Sweden; and Prince George of the United Kingdom. The Princess grew up on the royal estate of Skaugum in Asker and was privately educated. During World War II, she joined her family fleeing the Nazis and spent the war with her mother, brother and sister in exile in Washington, DC.

After the war, the Princess studied economics and political history at Oxford.

From her mother's death in April 1954 until her brother's marriage in August 1968, Princess Astrid was the First Lady of Norway, working side-by-side with her father on all representation duties, including State Visits.

Princess Astrid raised her family in Vinderen; she and her husband now live in Nordmarka, Oslo. Her hobbies include knitting, embroidery, reading and painting porcelain. 

In 2005, she took part in ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, including the unveiling of a plaque marking the Norwegian monarch's exile in London.

In February 2012, Princess Astrid celebrated her 80th birthday with a private dinner at the Royal Palace in Oslo.
