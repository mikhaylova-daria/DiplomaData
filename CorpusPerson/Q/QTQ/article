QTQ is an Australian television station, licensed to, and serving Brisbane, Queensland. It is owned by the Nine Entertainment Co., and is part of the Nine Network. It broadcasts on VHF channel 9 (analog) and VHF channel 8 (digital). QTQ began broadcasting on 16 August 1959, the first of the Brisbane stations to launch. 2009 marked the 50 year anniversary for the station.

The station was an independent member of the network before Alan Bond purchased the station, and integrated it into the Nine Network when he had control of it in the 1980s.

News
QTQ-9's nightly news program is Nine News Queensland, presented on weeknights by Andrew Lofthouse and Melissa Downes, with Wally Lewis presenting sport, and Garry Youngberry presenting the weather. Eva Milic is the weekend presenter with Ian Healy presenting sport. Paul Burt also presents Surfing and Fishing reports each Friday and Saturday evening. Paul Burt presents weather on the weekends

Wally Lewis was the weekday sports presenter until December 2006, when following an on-air incident, it was publicly revealed he had epilepsy. He returned to presenting sport during the 2007/2008 summer period, and also files sports reports. Chris Bombolas was the weekend sports presenter who preceded Haddan, before resigning to become a politician. John Schluter was the weather presenter until his resignation in September 2006, and now works for rival Seven News Brisbane as the weekday weather presenter.

Mike London was the weekend presenter alongside Heather Foord until his resignation in June 2003 following allegations that he had arrangements for a female fan to complain about weeknight presenter Bruce Paige, who was at the time co-presenting with Jillian Whiting. London had swapped roles with Paige in the mid 1990s following Paige's return to the Nine Network.

Paige and Foord have presented the weekday bulletins together since late 2004. Jillian Whiting preceded Foord after she took up weekend presenting with Mike London in 2002. Foord returned to weeknight presenting in 2005. In December 2008, Foord announced that she will step down from presenting weeknights to spend more time with her family. Weekend news presenter Melissa Downes replaced her with Eva Milic and Andrew Lofthouse replacing Downes as Weekend news presenters.

The Brisbane bulletin was the last news program to date in Australia to use the dual-presenter format on weekends (when London was presenting with Foord), until the Perth bulletin revived it in early 2008.

This bulletin is also shown on Imparja Television as of 2008.
