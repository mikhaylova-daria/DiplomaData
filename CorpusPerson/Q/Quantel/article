Quantel is a company based in the United Kingdom and founded in 1973 that designs and manufactures digital production equipment for the broadcast television, video production and motion picture industries. They are headquartered in Newbury, Berkshire.

The name Quantel comes from Quantised Television which is making reference to the process of converting a television picture into a digital signal.

History 
Quantel founder, Peter Michael, had previously founded Micro Consultants Group (MCG). MCG had pioneered a range of fast data conversion products that could be used for converting video signals from analog to digital and back to analog. These devices found use in many early Quantel products.

In the 1980s, Peter Michael merged Quantel (along with his other interests) into the UEI Group of companies. Peter became Chairman with Quantel remaining a privately owned company of the publicly quoted UEI. Under the leadership of Richard Taylor OBE, chairman from 1975 and Paul Kellar MBE, Quantel made several pioneering firsts in video:

* In 1975, they released the first all-digital framestore, the Quantel DFS 3000. It was first introduced in TV coverage of the 1976 Montreal Olympics to generate a picture-in-picture inset of the Olympics' flaming torch while the rest of the picture featured the runner entering the stadium. Framestore technology provided the cornerstone for the future development of digital television products.

* In 1981, they released the Paintbox, an extremely advanced television graphics system for its time. Paintboxes are still in use today due to their image quality, and versatility. The Weather Channel was the first customer in the United States to purchase a Paintbox in 1982 (they had serial number '1' in the USA), which was used to generate their on-air weather maps during their first years of operation. MTV was another early customer of the Paintbox.

* When the BBC weather department decided to move from magnetic weather symbols on a board in 1985 to a complete digital solution they used modified Paintboxes which were controlled via Apple Lisa computers. The weather presenter then stood in front of a blue screen holding a button that was connected to the Lisa; which then in turn communicated with the Paintbox to bring up the next slide.

* In 1985, Quantel released the "Harry" effects compositing system/non-linear editor. The Harry was designed to render special effects in non-real time to the video recorded on its built-in hard disk array (much like most computer based non-linear editing systems today). The hard disk array used drives made by Fujitsu, and were connected to the Harry using a proprietary parallel interface, much like a modern-day RAID array. Technically, it was the first all-digital non-linear editing system, since it could also do editing of the video that was recorded on the Harry. Due to technical constraints of the time, the Harry could only record 80 seconds of video, albeit encoded in full broadcast-quality, uncompressed D1-style 8-bit CCIR 601 format. This aside, the Harry was quite an advanced machine, and the only system like it for its time.

* In 1992, Quantel released "Henry" the first Multi Layer compositing system that became the worldwide industry standard for commercials production and went on win the British Government's Queens Award for Export Achievement, Quantel's 9th such award.

This period until 1998 marked the high point of the Company's profitability, size and market position, placing it in the top 5 of Broadcast vendors. The company had a global presence with major offices, staff and facilities on the east and west coast of the USA, in Paris, Tokyo, London, Seoul, Hong Kong and Sydney, plus other overseas resources. There was a private air operation - Quantel Aviation - based in Farnborough which included a private Citation IV executive jet, a helicopter and Shrike. However, as software based products began to gain ground in Quantel's then core businesses of compositing, graphics and news editing, the company was not able to maintain this position.

Recent history

In 1989 Quantel had been acquired from UEI by Carlton Communications who had also acquired high end sound console manufacturer Solid State Logic as part of the same deal. This relationship ended in 2000 when Quantel management bought the company back for $76.6m.

From 2000 to 2005, Quantel then specialized in:

* sQ - Video server based system for the broadcast industry which is designed for all forms of fast turnaround production, such as sports and news
* Newsbox - Complete news production system in a box
* iQ - Used for digital intermediate film work
* eQ - Used for post production and TV commercial work
* Pablo - Color grading system
* Mission - A Media and Asset management system for handling media in large systems

December 2005 saw the departure from the board of long-standing Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Taylor OBE to be replaced by Ray Cross. Prior to this Cross had worked as an external consultant with Taylor to create the business plan to present to Lloyds Banking Group venture capital arm LDC for the 2000 management buyout from Carlton Communications. Richard was subsequently diagnosed with cancer in December 2008 and died in June 2009.

Research & Development Director Paul Kellar MBE also departed, replaced by Cross with another Quantel employee, Neil Hinson. Neil had joined Quantel in 1980 and played a key part in the design of many classic Quantel products including Harry, Henry, Mirage and Clipbox as well as the later successful generationQ family of products but departed in January 2008, to be replaced by Cross with another Quantel employee, Simon Rogers.

In the autumn of 2008 Cross engaged in restructuring, including a sizeable round of redundancies. The reason given was that the company was moving towards being more software based. Another round of redundancies took place in April 2009. The reason given for this was that the global recession has been deeper than they had planned for. There was another round of redundancies in October 2012. The reason given was that their quarterly results were not as good as they had planned for.

In March 2014 Quantel acquired Snell Ltd. and began the consolidation of the two companies. Although both companies sit in the media technology space, each had quite separate, but complementary products. Cross then engaged in more restructuring and further redundancies occurred.

 Headquarters and manufacturing 
Quantel has been based at 31 Turnpike Road, Newbury, Berkshire, England since 1982. The building was built on the site in 1940 for Vickers Armstrong and manufactured Spitfire fighter aircraft during World War II. Air raid shelters are still present in the grounds of the site. Other users of the building included the Post Office and the Ministry of Transport.

A large part of the current site is dedicated to manufacturing. It is now very rare that companies manufacture their own products due to the complex nature of multiple layer circuit boards containing high density surface mounted components. It is more common now to design complex circuits on a computer and await delivery of a ready built board.

New circuit boards in turn contain large Field Programmable Gate Array chips which can be programmed when a device starts up. This can create a single circuit board which previously would have been made up of a larger amount of chips across more boards all requiring manufacturing and testing with increased cost.

 Effect Systems Limited 
As part of ongoing restructuring during the 1990s, Quantel decided to outsource support of legacy products to a separate company Effect Systems. Also based in Newbury and staffed by many ex Quantel staff, Effect Systems took over support for products. These include Editbox, Henry, Hal, Paintbox, Picturebox, Domino as well as older products dating back to the 1980s including Mirage, Harry and Encore.

On 1 October 2008 Quantel ended the outsourcing contract with Effect Systems. Effect will continue to offer independent support for Quantel legacy equipment.

Product technology and usage
Traditionally, Quantel systems were based around proprietary hardware & software. With the introduction of the generationQ range a number of Quantel products are now based on Microsoft Windows and standard PC hardware. Custom hardware is still used on the sQ servers and high end clients like the sQ Edit Plus and iQ systems.

Quantel has always been very protective of their product designs and patents especially relating to Paintbox type functionality. This triggered a number of legal battles over the years, most notably against Spaceward Graphics and their Matisse system (won in 1990) and Adobe Systems and their Photoshop application (lost in 1997).

The majority of Quantel products use code names for some parts of their systems. One source of code names was the television series The Magic Roundabout. The Dylan disk system and the Zebedee processor take their names from characters in this series.

Many of the major movies released since 1999 have been created or manipulated using Quantel technology, including Star Wars episode 2 and 3, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Day After Tomorrow, and Sin City. Paintbox made today is a complete new design to the earlier "Paintbox Classic" and is part of the integrated sQ offering. Picturebox sQ - a device that can play graphics sequences (clips) as well as the more traditional stillimages generated by the new Paintbox, joined the line-up in 2005.

Quantel hardware is used in some form by most broadcasters around the world. Users of sQ server based systems include ESPN in the USA, Rogers Media in Canada, and BBC, BSkyB and QVC in the United Kingdom.

Quantel copied an idea from mobile phone companies and introduced 'Pay as you Go HD'. This allowed customers to purchase high definition capable equipment but use it for standard definition and only pay for high definition when required.

 Quantel-designed technologies 
Dynamic Rounding - Dynamic Rounding is a technique devised by Quantel for truncating the word length of pixels – a process you can't avoid when you are processing images. Rather than simply losing the lower bits, Dynamic Rounding uses their information to control, via a randomiser, the dither of the LSB of the truncated result. This effectively removes any artefacts that would otherwise be visible. Dynamic rounding is non-cumulative on any number of passes and produces statistically correct results. Dynamic rounding eliminates any truncation artefacts.

FrameMagic - A system used on video servers where video clips are treated as individual frames rather than a single clip. This allows very efficient use of storage as only frames used in subsequent edits need to be kept from an original recording. This allows the rest of the unused frames to be discarded.

TimeMagic - A background rendering system which renders editing effects as the operator continues working.

Resolution Co-existence - Allows a video edit to be made up of different formats of source material without any extra work required by the operator. One example is an edit that will play out standard definition but some parts of the edit may be part of a high definition source clip.

Genetic Engineering - A technology that allows multiple users to work on the same media independently without having to have multiple copies of it.
