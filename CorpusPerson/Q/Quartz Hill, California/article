General information
Quartz Hill is located in the High Desert of California north of the Los Angeles area. As recently as the 1970s the town was largely agricultural, with cash crops of almonds, alfalfa and turkeys. The almond orchards being crippled by disease and the alfalfa growers having to contend with their water rights being diverted (to a growing Los Angeles) caused a significant shift in the local work force. The shift mainly was toward the nearby aerospace plants of Lockheed Martin and Rockwell International. Its fields long empty, Quartz Hill still celebrates the Almond Blossom Festival every year. Quartz Hill schools include High Desert Bible College, Quartz Hill Elementary School, Sundown Elementary School and Joe Walker Middle School (students in parts of Quartz Hill go to Del Sur Elementary School in Antelope Acres), and Quartz Hill High School.
