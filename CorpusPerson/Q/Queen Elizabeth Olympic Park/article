Queen Elizabeth II Olympic Park, in London, United Kingdom, is a sporting complex built for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics, situated to the east of the city adjacent to the Stratford City development. It contains the athletes' Olympic Village and several of the sporting venues including the Olympic Stadium and London Aquatics Centre, besides the London Olympics Media Centre. The park is overlooked by the ArcelorMittal Orbit, an observation tower and Britain's largest piece of public art. It was simply called Olympic Park during the Games but was renamed afterward to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, (though it is not an official Royal Park of London). The park occupies an area straddling four east London boroughs; Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Waltham Forest. Part of the park reopened in July 2013, with a large majority of the rest (including the Aquatics Centre, Velopark and Orbit observation tower) reopening in April 2014.

Location
The site covers parts of Stratford, Bow, Leyton, and Hackney Wick in East London, overlooking the A12 road. The site was previously a mixture of greenfield and brownfield land, including parts of Hackney Marshes.

The Royal Mail gave the park and Stratford City the postcode E20, which had previously only appeared in the television soap opera EastEnders for the fictional suburb of Walford.

Design
The park was designed by the EDAW Consortium (including EDAW and Buro Happold), working with Arup and WS Atkins. The park, including legacy, was taken over by LDA Design in conjunction with Hargreaves Associates and in collaboration with Arup and Atkins. LDA design contracted Wallace whittle to carry out various aspects of the M+E Building services design. The NHBC carried out the Sustainability assessments. The park was illuminated with a lighting scheme designed by Sutton Vane Associates.

London's Olympic and Paralympic bid proposed that there would be four indoor arenas in the park in addition to the main venues, but the revised master plan published in 2006 reduced this to three, with the volleyball events moved to the Earls Court Exhibition Centre. The fencing arena was also cancelled, with the fencing events taking place at ExCeL London. The remaining indoor arenas are the Basketball Arena and the Copper Box, in addition to the Water Polo Arena, the Aquatics Centre, and the Velopark. The final design of the park was approved by the Olympic Delivery Authority and its planning-decisions committee.

Construction
During its construction over 80,000 workers were engaged on the project. To enable the major phase of construction to begin, the 52 electricity pylons, up to high, that dominated the landscape in and around the park were removed, and the electricity for the park is now run through underground tunnels.

Legacy

The park has a number of uses after the most 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London as:

*A part of the East London Tech City technology hub.
*One of the largest urban parks created in Europe for more than 150 years, designed to enrich the local ecology by restoring wetland habitats and planting native species.
* A university exploiting the sporting facilities and high-tech communications infrastructure remaining specialising in sport science, digital media and green technology.
* 3,600 apartments, the East Village, next to the Stratford City neighbourhood of Stratford, London.
* The Manor Garden Allotments (reinstated after alternative use).
* The (ArcelorMittal) Orbit, a steel tower which is the largest public work of art in the UK and a tourist attraction.
*On 27 February 2012, it was announced that the UK's main Olympic Museum will be opened at the park in 2014 next to the (ArcelorMittal) Orbit. The plans were shelved in 2013.
*Several institutions are planning outposts at the park, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, University of the Arts London, and the Sadler's Wells Ballet Company.
*The University College of London intends to build a new campus within the park.
*The Smithsonian Institute announced in January 2015 that it is in talks to build its first permanent overseas exhibition space within the Olympic Park.

On 2 August 2011, it was announced the five neighbourhoods of housing and amenities (anti-clockwise from north-east) are:
*Chobham Manor in the London Borough of Newham
*East Wick in the London Borough of Hackney (by Hackney Wick)
*Sweetwater in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets
*Pudding Mill in the London Borough of Newham
*Marshgate Wharf in the London Borough of Newham
*The International Quarter in the London Borough of Newham

These names have relevant history in the area. All four of the East London boroughs covering the park as such have a neighbourhood except for Waltham Forest.

The International Quarter

The International Quarter is a new commercial district in Stratford, East London, which hosted the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It will be a mixed-use development, with a total investment of in excess of Â£1.3 billion, and will be delivered by Lend Lease and London & Continental Railways in a 50/50 joint venture.

The International Quarter will include 4 million sq ft of commercial office space, 330 homes known as Glasshouse Gardens and a new hotel.

The area is accessible via Stratford station, which is on the Central and Jubilee lines of the London Underground, as well as National Rail, Overground, and DLR. The International Quarter can also be reached via Stratford International station, and Crossrail is due to arrive in 2019.

Future international sporting events

Although the sporting venues in the park were reduced in scale after the conclusion of London 2012, part of the legacy is to ensure the continued use of those facilities that are permanent, as local and community resources and for major international sporting events that make use of the world class facilities constructed for the Olympics and Paralympics:
*The Stadium will host the London Grand Prix athletics event starting in 2013.
*The third stage of the 2014 Tour de France between Cambridge and The Mall in London will pass through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/21056721
*In September 2014 the first Invictus Games was held in the park. 
*In 2010, a bid was submitted to use the Stadium as the venue for the 2015 World Athletics Championships. Due to the then uncertainty over the future use of the stadium, this bid was withdrawn, with instead a subsequent bid for the 2017 World Championships submitted instead. The success of this bid was announced in November 2011.
*It was announced in March 2012 that England will host the 2015 European Hockey Championships, which will take place at the revamped Lee Valley Hockey Centre.
*London was announced as the only formal bidder for the 2017 IPC World Athletic Championships in October 2012.
*In December 2012 the International Tennis Federation announced that the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre would host the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters between 2014 and 2016.

London has also bid for the right to hold both the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and the LEN European Aquatics Championships in 2016, which would be held at the Velodrome and Aquatics Centre respectively.

Resident sports clubs
In addition to the use of the venues for international events, some of them are intended for use on a regular basis by amateur and professional sports teams in various sports.

Olympic Stadium

On 11 February 2011, West Ham United were selected as preferred bidders, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, to take over the stadium as a football venue after the end of the games. However, five days later Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn announced that he would be challenging the decision to allow West Ham to relocate to the stadium, as he believed that having West Ham playing within one mile of their Brisbane Road stadium could cost Orient support and even their existence. Incidentally, Hearn had expressed interest some years earlier in moving Orient to Olympic Park and reducing its capacity to 25,000 seats, while West Ham would cut the capacity to 60,000 if their relocation went ahead.

Copper Box
The Copper Box will be the only permanent indoor arena remaining after the end of London 2012. Built primarily for use in the handball and goalball competitions, it will be converted to a multi-use venue that will include use for basketball. As a result of the owners of the Prestige Homes Arena in Milton Keynes terminating their lease, the London Lions basketball club, after a season at the National Sports Centre, Selhurst, will relocate to the Copper Box (upon conversion).

Lee Valley Hockey Centre
The Lee Valley Hockey Centre was borne from a revamp of the Olympic Legacy Hockey Facility. The facility is the current ground of Wapping Hockey Club. The centre includes 2 state-of-the-art hockey pitches and is operated by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority.

Concerts
In January 2013 music concert promoter Live Nation won the right to stage shows at the stadium and in the surrounding park. The park hosted the music events in July 2013, but the stadium was not used. The former site of the Riverbank Arena is set to be used to stage the Hard Rock Calling, Wireless and Electric Daisy Carnival festivals .

Criticism
Rowan Moore, writing in the Guardian when the QE Park opened, commented that 'There is a frenzy of wacky light fittings, of playground installations, of seats, tree species, sculptural lumps of granite, kiosks, railings and coloured surfaces...It suffers from an Olympic syndrome, where everyone wants to be a Mo or a Jessica and make their mark. No one, except perhaps the admirable Oudolf, wants to do the quiet stuff. Certainly not the student housing developers Unite, who have built an astoundingly ugly block of 1,001 units between the Athletes' Village and Westfield shopping centre that looms aggressively in almost every vista. Great care was taken to make the Athletes' Village aesthetically orderly, to the point where it began to resemble Ceausescu's Bucharest: this eruption makes such efforts futile'. 
Robert Holden and Tom Turner, in a review of the Olympic Park's landscape architecture state that 'Our fundamental point is that "the landscape planning is much better than the landscape design". The landscape planning includes the opening up of the River Lea in the northern section of the park, the habitat-creation strategy and the park's excellent links with its hinterland. The landscape design is dominated by vast pedestrian concourses which will be busy during events but will resemble unused airport runways on every other occasion. There is some good garden-type planting but it has not been used to make "gardens": it is used more like strips of planting beside highways'.
