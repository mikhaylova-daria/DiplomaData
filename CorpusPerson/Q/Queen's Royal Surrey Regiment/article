The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment was an infantry regiment of the British Army which existed from 1955 to 1966. It has since amalgamated twice and its lineage is carried on by the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires).

History
As a consequence of defence cuts in the late 1950s, the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) and the East Surrey Regiment were amalgamated on 14 October 1959 to form the 1st Battalion, Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment.

In 1959 the 1st Battalion deployed to Cyprus and the following year arrived in the British bases in Libya, while a detachment was sent to Cyprus. In 1961 the 1st Queen's Surreys was sent to Aden—now part of the Yemen. In 1962 the regiment joined the Hong Kong garrison, remaining there on a 2-year posting before heading for Münster, West Germany in 1964 as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). 

In 1966 the regiment's short existence came to an end when it, along with the three other remaining regiments of the Home Counties Brigade, was amalgamated to form The Queen's Regiment, one of the new 'large' regiments that were formed in the 1960s. Since the Queens Regiment amalgamation in 1992 the traditions and lineage are upheld by the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires).

Territorials
When the regiment was formed, the Territorial Army battalions of the merging regiments continued to use their former titles. However, in 1961, a reduction in the size of the TA lead to the formation of 3rd and 4th Queen's Surreys:
*3rd Battalion (TA) was formed of units affiliated to the Queen’s Royal Regiment: the 5th and 6th Battalions and the 565th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (the successor to 4th Battalion). Its headquarters were in Guildford.
*4th Battalion (TA) was formed from former battalions of the East Surrey Regiment: the 6th East Surreys and the 23rd London Regiment. The battalion headquarters were in Kingston upon Thames.

The two territorial battalions were disbanded in 1967, with their successor units in the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) being "A" Company (Queen's Surreys) of the 5th (Volunteer) Battalion, The Queen's Regiment and the 6th (Territorial) Battalion, The Queen's Regiment (Queen's Surreys).

The Surrey Infantry Museum
The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment archives were put in storage when Regimental Headquarters and Museum in the Keep at Kingston upon Thames closed. Colonel JW Sewell reached agreement with the National Trust to re-establish the regiment's museum at Clandon Park, West Clandon The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment Museum opened in 1981 with exhibits including uniforms, medals, weapons, regalia, photographs and memorabilia. The museum was upgraded in 2001. In 2011, with part funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund further redevelopment took place and, in July that year, the museum merged with those of the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment and the Queen’s Regiment to become The Surrey Infantry Museum.

The regiment's archives and library are located at the Surrey History Centre in Woking.
