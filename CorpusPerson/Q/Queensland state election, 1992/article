Elections were held in the Australian state of Queensland on 19 September 1992 to elect the 89 members of the state's Legislative Assembly.

The Australian Labor Party led by Wayne Goss was reelected for a second term with a strong majority government. The election effectively confirmed the status quo, although the ALP lost a small percentage of votes and seats.

This was the first election in many decades in which a zonal system of electoral representation did not exist. The previous parliament legislated for a "one vote one value" electoral redistribution in which almost all the 89 electoral districts were to have similar numbers of electors (within a 10% margin of the mean); the only exceptions were electorates that had areas of at least 100,000 square kilometres; the number of electors in each of these electorates was increased by 2% of the total area of the electorate expressed in square kilometres for the purposes of ensuring that the number of electors in that electorate was within 10% of the mean enrolment.

Although Labor suffered a small swing against it in north Queensland, this was slightly masked by the abolition of the zonal system.

Key dates Date Event 25 August 1992 Writs were issued by the Governor to proceed with an election. 29 August 1992 Close of electoral rolls. 1 September 1992 Close of nominations. 19 September 1992 Polling day, between the hours of 8am and 6pm. 24 September 1992 The Goss Ministry was reconstituted. 31 October 1992 The writ was returned and the results formally declared.
