Its football squad currently plays in the Primera División, the top division of the Argentine football league system. 

Other sports practised at the club are basketball, gymnastics, martial arts, roller skating, swimming, field hockey and tennis.

History
Origins and organization
The origins of the club can be found at the "Quilmes and Polo Club", an institution founded by British immigrants about 1880. In 1887 the club changed its name to "Quilmes Rovers Athletic Club" with a football team formed entirely by British people. That team took part in the second edition of Argentine Primera División championship held in 1893.

On 5 November 1897, promoting an initiative by priest J.T. Stevenson, the "Quilmes Cricket Club" is founded. The club changed its name to "Quilmes Athletic Club" in 1901, the year that Quilmes registered to Argentine Association Football League (former Argentine Football Association). 

By the time that Quilmes was founded, the only club existing in Quilmes was the Quilmes Lawn Tennis Club. Guillermo Morgan was named president, becoming the first chairman of the recently created institution. During its first years, Quilmes did not admitted non-British members. The club represented to the huge British community that worked at Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway. At the beginning of its existence, the main sport practised at Quilmes was cricket, and club's colors were crimson and blue.

In March 1898 Quilmes Cricket Club added football as sport. In 1901 the club also changed its colors, adopting the England national football team's, white shirt with blue collar and shorts. By the first years of 20th century the club began to admit Argentine members, following the example of the other institution of the city, Argentino de Quilmes, which had been founded as a reaction to British rules for memberships. Unlike Quilmes CC, Argentino was opened to receive Argentine members.

Controversy
The club settled on 5 November 1887 as the date of its foundation, considering Quilmes and Polo Club (then Quilmes Rovers AC) as its predecessor. Nevertheless, Argentine football historian Jorge Gallego stated the original institution founded in 1887 was dissolved and the Quilmes Cricket Club was in fact a completely new institution, not related with other clubs previously founded in the city of Quilmes. 

First success
Quilmes was the first team (amongst the one that are still active) to face legendary Alumni, in 1901. Alumni beat Quilmes 1-0 and 3-1, keeping its supremacy until 1906 when Quilmes achieved its first victory, defeating Alumni 4-2.

In 1912 Quilmes won its first title, the Primera División championship. The team was formed by many British players that had played for Alumni, dissolved one year before. The team remained in the top division of football until 1937, when it was relegated along with Argentinos Juniors to the second division.

Return to success
The team played in Primera B until 1949 when Quilmes won the title promoting to Primera. Quilmes finished the season scored the most goals during the tournament (118). In 1959 the club changed its name again, turning to the Spanish denomination Quilmes Atlético Club which has remained since.

After being relegated again in 1951, Quilmes won the second division championship and promoted to Primera, after the Football Association stated that Newell's Old Boys (who had finished first and proclaimed champion) promised Excursionistas an amount of money if they defeated Quilmes. As a result, the title was given to Quilmes (which had finished 2nd after Newell's) which promoted to Primera instead of Rosarino team.


Quilmes lasted only season at the top division, being relegated in 1962 and returning to Primera 3 years later, along with champion Colón de Santa Fe. The club would be relegated again in 1970. Five years later, Quilmes won the Primera B title, promoting along with champion San Telmo. 

In 1978 Quilmes won the Torneo Metropolitano, being its only title in Primera to date. That team, coached by José Yudica, had notable players such as Jorge Gáspari, Horacio Milozzi, top-scorer Luis Andreuchi and Omar "El Indio" Gómez, considered the greatest idol in club's history. The next year Quilmes played the 1979 Copa Libertadores but the team did not qualify for the second round being eliminated.

The dark years
In 1980 Quilmes was relegated to Primera B, returning to Primera just one year later along with champion Nueva Chicago after finishing 2nd. Quilmes made a great performance during the 1981 Torneo Nacional reaching the finals where the team was finally beaten by Ferro Carril Oeste. The next season Quilmes could not repeat the good performance and was relegated again to second division. In 1986, due to a major restructuring in the Argentine league system, a new division, "Primera B Nacional" is created. Quilmes did not qualify to play there so the team continued at Primera B, which became the third division after the restructuring.

In 1987 Quilmes won the 1986-87 Primera B Metropolitana title, promoting to National B. That same year construction of the new stadium started. In 1991 Quilmes returned to Primera División after 10 years playing at lower divisions, when beat Club Almirante Brown 1-0. The squad only lasted one season in Primera, returning to Nacional B.

In 1995 Quilmes inaugurated its new stadium, named "Estadio Centenario Dr. José Luis Meiszner" playing a friendly match against Club Nacional de Football. During the following seasons, Quilmes would have many chances to promote but the team did not achieve its objective, losing the final playoffs at the hands of Huracán, Los Andes, and Banfield. Moreover, Quilmes lost another two chanced for promotion when being defeated by Belgrano both times.

Last years
Quilmes finally got the long-awaited promotion to Primera in 2002-03 season, after leaving behind Argentinos Juniors with scores of 1-0 and 0-0.

After two good campaigns in primera, Quilmes qualified to play the 2005 Copa Libertadores. The team passed the first stage although it was soon eliminated. Quilmes would be later relegated to Nacional B in 2006-07 season, but the squad returned to the top division in 2009-10 season along with Olimpo and All Boys. Just one year later Quilmes was again relegated to the second division, where the team remained until 2012.

On June 2012 Quilmes returned to Primera División, after being placed 2nd in Primera B Nacional. The Cervecero defeated Guillermo Brown de Puerto Madryn 2-0 in the last fixture totalizing 72 points, therefore promoting after champion River Plate.

Uniforms
