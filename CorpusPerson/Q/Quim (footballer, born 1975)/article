Joaquim Manuel Sampaio da Silva, OIH (born 13 November 1975), known as Quim , is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for C.D. Aves as a goalkeeper.

He played in nearly 400 top division games during his career, over twelve seasons with Braga and six with Benfica, and won five major titles with the latter.

Quim represented Portugal at the 2006 World Cup and in two European Championships, gaining 32 caps.

Club career

Braga
Born in Vila Nova de Famalicão, Braga, Quim started his career at S.C. Braga. 

He played his first game in the first division during the 1994–95 season, becoming the club's undisputed first-choice in the following years.

Benfica
Quim moved to S.L. Benfica in 2004 and was, at first, intermittent in keeping the goalkeeper spot at his new club, having shared the goal with José Moreira in the title-winning 2004–05 campaign. Next season he started as first-choice, but injury to him as well as Moreira saw Marcelo Moretto being signed during the winter break, controversially earning a place in the starting eleven.

Quim's fortunes turned around at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, as new coach Fernando Santos announced the former Braga player would be his first goalkeeper. Subsequently, the latter rarely put in a bad performance since regaining first-choice status, even when the manager was dismissed early into the following campaign.

In 2008–09, with Benfica retaining the same three goalkeepers under Quique Flores, Quim started the campaign, lost the job to Moreira in between, was even demoted to third-choice (with Moretto starting in the domestic league cup), and finished again as starter, with the Reds eventually finishing third. He also started the 2009 League Cup final and saved three penalty shoot-out attempts against Sporting Clube de Portugal for the win.

Braga return
In the 2009–10 season Quim played all the matches and minutes as Benfica won the league for the first time in five years, adding to this the honour of being the keeper with less conceded goals (20). At the end of June 2010, however, the 34-year-old was released, returning to first professional club Braga on a three-year deal, but spent his first year on the sidelines nursing an achilles tendon injury.

Quim returned as first-choice for the 2011–12 campaign, helping Braga to the third place with the subsequent qualification to the UEFA Champions League. However, after the arrival of Beto from F.C. Porto for the following season, he only featured in six official contests in its first part, including once in the league against S.C. Beira-Mar and the 1–2 Champions League home loss to Galatasaray SK.

After Beto left for Sevilla FC in January 2013 Quim was reinstated as the starter, one of his first appearances being a 0–0 home draw against former club Benfica in the campaign's Portuguese League Cup semifinals, won in a penalty shootout. Manager José Peseiro also selected him for the competition's decider against Porto, where a penalty by Alan signified the game's only goal and Braga's first trophy win in 47 years.

Later years
In May 2013, at nearly 38 years of age, Quim announced he would not renew his contract with Braga and subsequently retire after 19 years as a professional –he played his last match on the 11th against C.D. Nacional, a 1–3 home loss for his 382nd game in the Portuguese top level. However, two months later, he went back on his decision and signed for C.D. Aves in division two.

International career
After representing his country at every level from the under-16s upwards, and winning the UEFA European Under-19 Championship (then under-18) in 1994, Quim made his senior debut in August 1999 in a 4–0 victory against Andorra, after which he was Portugal's third-choice keeper at UEFA Euro 2000, enjoying a short cameo as a substitute in the 3–0 win against Germany in the group stage's final round before establishing himself as number one in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. However, a failed drug test saw him miss out on the competition held in South Korea and Japan.

Quim was second-choice for the national side during both Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, behind the habitual Ricardo. He was originally named in the Portugal squad for Euro 2008 but suffered a wrist injury the day before Portugal's first game, ruling him out of the tournament – he was replaced by Porto's Nuno.

Quim started the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign as first-choice, but lost his place midway through it to another Braga player, Eduardo, as Portugal eventually qualified. After being league champion for Benfica, he would be left out of the squad for the final stages in South Africa.
