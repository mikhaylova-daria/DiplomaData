U.S. News & World Report's 2013 America's Best Colleges issue has ranked Quinnipiac University first among northern universities with master's degree programs as having made the most promising and innovative changes in academics, faculty, campus or facilities. Quinnipiac is home to the well-known Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.

History

Quinnipiac University was founded in 1929 by Samuel W. Tator, a business professor and politician. Judge Phillip Troup, a Yale College graduate, and Tator's wife, Irmagarde Tator, a Mount Holyoke College graduate, also played major roles in the fledgling institution's founding and nurturing; the former became its first president until his death in 1939; the latter, its first bursar.

Quinnipiac was conceived in reaction to Northeastern University's abandonment of its New Haven, Connecticut program at the onset of the Great Depression. Originally, Quinnipiac was located in New Haven and called Connecticut College of Commerce. On opening its doors in 1929, it enrolled under 200, and its first graduating class featured only eight students. At the time, it awarded only associate's degrees. In 1935, the college changed its name to Junior College of Commerce.

From 1943 to 1945, the college closed, as nearly its entire student body was drafted into World War II. Upon re-opening, the college's enrollment nearly quadrupled to approximately 800 students.

In 1951, the institution was renamed Quinnipiac College, in honor of the Quinnipiac Indian tribe that once inhabited Greater New Haven. That same year, Quinnipiac began to confer bachelor's degrees. In 1952, Quinnipiac expanded rapidly, both physically and in terms of curriculum, relocating to a larger campus in New Haven, and also assuming administrative control of Larson College, a private women's college.

In 1966, after having outgrown its campus in New Haven, Quinnipiac moved to its current campus in the Mount Carmel section of Hamden, Connecticut, at the foot of Sleeping Giant Park. During the 1970s, Quinnipiac began to offer master's degrees in a variety of disciplines.

Until the 1990s, Quinnipiac remained primarily a commuter college with only a regional reputation; however, that changed during the next decade. In 1995, three major events occurred: the University of Bridgeport's law school migrated to Quinnipiac; the American Bar Association accredited Quinnipiac to award the Juris Doctor degree; and the Quinnipiac School of Law Center was dedicated. Also, during the mid-1990s, Quinnipiac's communications and business programs, respectively, built state-of-the-art facilities and attracted nationally-respected professors.

On July 1, 2000, the school officially changed its name to Quinnipiac University — to reflect its relatively new breadth in academic offerings. That same year, Quinnipiac University received accreditation by AACSB.

Currently, Quinnipiac offers 58 undergraduate majors, 20 graduate programs, and a JD program. Quinnipiac's Physician's Assistant (PA) program is ranked 11th nationally by U.S. News & World Report. Its Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine admitted 60 students to its first class in 2013. Quinnipiac's Polling Institute is noted for excellence and accuracy by national and international news organizations, and is often cited during election campaigns.

The university operates several media outlets, including a professionally-run commercial radio station, WQUN, founded by journalist and Quinnipiac professor Lou Adler. The university also operates a student-run FM radio station WQAQ, which concurrently streams on the Internet. A student-run television station, Q30, can be viewed only on campus. Also, a student-produced newspaper, The Chronicle, established in 1929, publishes 2,500 copies every Wednesday. Students also run a literary magazine, The Montage, a yearbook, The Summit, the Quinnipiac Bobcats Sports Network (an online sports-focused broadcast), and The Quinnipiac Barnacle (a parody news organization). Unaffiliated with the school, but run by students, is also an online newspaper, The Quad News.

Quinnipiac is home to one of the world's largest collections of art commemorating the Great Irish Famine. The collection is contained in Ireland's Great Hunger Museum (Músaem An Ghorta Mhóir) just off the Mount Carmel Campus.

In May 2014, Quinnipiac laid off 16 full-time but non-tenured faculty, with 11 of those from the College of Arts and Sciences, with no advance notice of the staff reduction. The cuts followed several years of a "stalled hiring" and a faculty salary freeze. The layoffs were mostly in departments that had experienced reduced enrollment in recent years, and enrollment is expected to be down by 12 percent in the fall 2014 term.

Campuses

Quinnipiac University consists of three campuses, the Mount Carmel and York Hill campuses in Hamden and North Haven Campus in North Haven, just north of New Haven, Connecticut.

The oldest of these campuses is the Mount Carmel campus, at the foot of Sleeping Giant State Park. The Arnold Bernhard Library, Carl Hansen Student Center, university administration, and many of the student residences may be found on this campus.

York Hill, located on a hill about a half-mile from the Mount Carmel campus, began with the development of the TD Bank Sports Center. In 2010 this was joined by a new student center as well as expanded parking and residence facilities as part of a $300 million expansion of the campus. York Hill is a "green" campus, making use of renewable energy and environmentally friendly resources, including one of the first major wind farms integrated into a university campus.

In 2007, Quinnipiac acquired a campus in North Haven, Connecticut from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, and has been gradually converting it for use by graduate programs at the university.

Quinnipiac University opened the Frank H. Netter M.D. School of Medicine in 2013.

Quinnipiac Polling Institute

Quinnipiac's Polling Institute receives national recognition for its independent surveys of residents throughout the United States. It conducts public opinion polls on politics and public policy as a public service as well as for academic research.
The poll has been cited by major news outlets throughout North America and Europe, including The Washington Post, Fox News, USA Today, The New York Times, CNN, and Reuters.

The polling operation began informally in 1988 in conjunction with a marketing class. It became serious in 1994 when the university hired a CBS News analyst to assess the data being gained. It subsequently focused on the Northeastern states, gradually expanding during presidential elections to cover swing states as well. The institute receives funding from the university, with its phone callers generally being work study students or local residents. The polls have been rated highly by Fivethirtyeight.com for accuracy in predicting primary and general elections.

Arnold Bernhard Library – The library is named for Arnold Bernhard, the founder and former chief executive officer of Value Line, Inc. Bernhard's son made the library renovation project possible by donating $1 million for the library project and an additional $3 million for the University's endowment in 1997. The donation was the largest in University history. The signature clock tower was replaced during the renovation which changed the icon of the school, which was a futuristic looking rocket ship spire, to a more conservative, modern tower. The Computer Help Desk has recently been relocated to the library. The Learning Center, renamed the Learning Commons, which includes a student tutoring program to help fellow peers in a variety of subjects is located here.

Athletics


The Quinnipiac Bobcats, previously the Quinnipiac Braves, comprise the school's athletic teams. They play in NCAA Division I in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, except for the men's and women's ice hockey teams, which are part of ECAC Hockey.

There are seven men's varsity sports and 14 women's varsity sports. There is no football team.

The team with the largest following on campus and in the area is the men's ice hockey team under established coach Rand Pecknold, which has been nationally ranked at times; during the 2009–2010 season they entered the top ten of the national polls for the first time. The team was the number-one nationally ranked hockey program for parts of the 2012-2013 season, reaching the Frozen Four for the first time in the program's history. They advanced to the national championship, ultimately falling to rival Yale.

The Quinnipiac women's ice hockey program had their most successful season in the 2009–10 NCAA Division I women's ice hockey season. Quinnipiac University added a women's golf and women's rugby team in the 2010–11 academic year.
In the late 2000s the men's basketball team gained a greater following than before under new head coach Tom Moore, a disciple of UConn Huskies men's basketball coach Jim Calhoun. Both men's and women's ice hockey and basketball teams play at the $52 million, 2007-opened TD Bank Sports Center. The women's lacrosse team has also been quite strong. The athletics program has been under pressures common to other universities, and at the close of the 2008–2009 academic year, men's golf, men's outdoor track and women's volleyball were dropped as a cost-cutting measure, although the last of these was restored (as a result of a Title IX suit).

Title IX discrimination case
On July 21, 2010, a federal judge ruled that Quinnipiac violated Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to provide equal treatment to women's athletic teams. The judge, Stefan Underhill, determined that Quinnipiac's decision to eliminate the women's volleyball team as well as its attempt to treat cheerleading as a competitive sport and its manipulation of reporting with regard to the numbers of male and female athletes amounted to unlawful discrimination against female students. Underhill ruled competitive cheerleading is currently too underdeveloped and unorganized and then ordered that the school maintain its volleyball program for the 2010-11 season.

Student journalism controversy
Quinnipiac has been at the center of controversy over the university's control over student publications and students' speech. The conflict has drawn national attention.

The problems began in the Fall 2007 semester, when junior Jason Braff, then editor of the Quinnipiac Chronicle, the official newspaper of the school, openly criticized a university policy that forbade the Chronicle from publishing news online before the content was published in the weekly print edition. Braff wrote an editorial about the policy and also gave an interview to the local Waterbury paper, Republican-American criticizing it.
Manuel Carreiro, Quinnipiac's vice president and dean of students, then sent a letter to Braff in November, telling him that his public disagreement with school policies "will seriously place your position and organization at risk with the university." Braff received an $8,000 annual stipend for his position, and the university said that its employees have more of a responsibility than other students to uphold policies. But Lynn Bushnell, QU's vice president for public affairs, denied threatening to fire Braff for disagreeing with school policies.
Braff and the Chronicle staff were also openly critical of a public relations policy requiring all news media inquiries and questions (including those from the Chronicle) for administrators to be sent, via e-mail, to the university's public relations department.

Quinnipiac officials agreed to discuss the policies with students, and eventually decided that making the Chronicle independent from the university would be the best idea. The school set forth a plan of action, which included the university appointing editors for the 2008–2009 academic year. Angry with this plan, Braff and other staff agreed to leave the Chronicle at the end of the spring 2008 semester, and all applicants for the editor positions withdrew their applications.

Former Chronicle staffers came back in Fall 2008 with Quad News, an independent newspaper with only a website and no print edition. Plans are to incorporate Quad News as its own business venture run on advertising revenue.
Quad News immediately faced opposition from the university. Staffers learned in September that university officials had instructed all varsity coaches, staff and athletes not to speak to Quad News reporters. 
Shortly after, officials threatened to shut down the university's chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), claiming that they violated school policy by using their meetings as a cover for Quad News meetings. The Quad News staff had used two SPJ meetings to meet, after the university took away Quad News meeting reservation, citing the fact that the organization was not a university-recognized club. Quad News promptly stopped their meetings with SPJ.
The move prompted a public letter from national SPJ leaders, expressing concern over the university's actions.
Both staffs recognize the other publication as legitimate and have wished each other luck in their friendly competition.
