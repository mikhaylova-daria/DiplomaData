Rede Manchete was a television network from Brazil. It first aired on June 5, 1983 in Rio de Janeiro and simultaneously in other 5 Brazilian cities, like São Paulo on Rede Exclesior's old channel 9 frequency. In Brasília, it was transmitted by TV Brasília.

 History 
 Early history 
The successor network not only to Rede Tupi but to Rede Excelsior, two former Brazilian television networks, it was owned by Adolpho Bloch, Ukrainian naturalized Brazilian, founder of the publishing group called "Bloch Editores", from half of the defunct Rede Tupi (the other half became SBT in 1981). Its slogan in 1983 is the unofficial slogan "A Televisão do ano 2000" (The Television of the year 2000) and the official "A TV de 1ª Classe" (First Class Television). Its first broadcasts started on 7:00 P.M. of Sunday, June 5, 1983, and resulted in such a rating spike in Rio de Janeiro that it suddenly moved to second place.
 
In the beginning, the network broadcast various shows and operas, like TV Record in 60s, bringing the focus for the A and B Classes. In 1984, Xuxa, early model and actress, presented the Clube da Criança program in 1984, beating sometimes TV Globo's morning show, Balão Magico. This was the year it began a rival coverage of the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, its most successful one.

By 1987, for the first time, Rede Manchete and Rede Globo jointly broadcast the Brazilian Carnival to all over the country. The next year however, the network was in a weak financial situation after just 5 years, but came out stronger.

 The Pantanal phenomenon 
1990 saw the launch of the telenovela Pantanal (named after the Pantanal wetlands on which it was set), which would beat the TV Globo telenovela Rainha da Sucata (Queen of the Junk) in popularity and score. The story mixes romance, very beautiful images of the Mato Grosso Pantanal and a bit of the supernatural. The plot centres around a son of a big farmer of Mato Grosso that comes to know his father for the first time, and also Juma, a wild lady that lives in a forest cabin and transforms herself in a jaguar when she's angry, with which he falls in love. Afterwards, Manchete continues making telenovelas, well known for their good image and content quality. They were exported to various countries, but never proved as successful as Pantanal or competing telenovelas from the Rede Globo.

 Crisis 
After various workers protests in 1992, and the death of Adolpho Bloch in 1995, Rede Manchete ceased their operations in May 1999, ironically, Manchete didn't reach the year 2000, but was reformatted. The concession of the Channel 9 of Sao Paulo and the Channel 6 of Rio de Janeiro being acquired by the TeleTV Group and later created RedeTV! using part of old structure in November that year, under new management and leadership. The change would also be beneficial to Brazilian television as RedeTV! soon became the first national network to fully broadcast in high definition.
