Ronan Vibert (born 1964) is an English actor, known for his appearances on British television.

Early life

He was born in Cambridgeshire, the son of Dilys (née Jackson) and David Vibert, both artists. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art from 1983 to 1986. He has a brother named Cevn.

Career
Vibert made his screen debut in 1989 in the TV series Traffik. He appeared in the BBC's The Buccaneers, in ITV's Cadfael, alongside Sir Derek Jacobi, and Van der Valk. He also appeared with Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in the televised adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse's satire of Edwardian and post World War I aristocratic England, Jeeves and Wooster as Wilmot, Lord Pershore ('Motty'). He came into his own as an actor as Maximilien Robespierre in the BBC's adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel, starring Richard E. Grant. Vibert's portrait of an intense and calm Robespierre as malevolent and without emotion, added to the reputation of this man as a truly frightening individual.

Vibert appeared in the episode of Midsomer Murders entitled "Death in Chorus". He also appeared in the episode of Waking The Dead entitled "Subterraneans" and an episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures entitled "The Last Sontaran".

Films include Shadow of the Vampire with John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe, The Cat's Meow directed by Peter Bogdanovich, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, Tristan & Isolde produced by Ridley Scott, Beowulf & Grendel as the author of the epic tale and the Oscar winning The Pianist directed by Roman Polanski. Vibert has also played the role of Lepidus in HBO's Rome.
