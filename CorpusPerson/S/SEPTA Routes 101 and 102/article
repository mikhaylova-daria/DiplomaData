SEPTA Trolley Routes 101 and 102 also known as the Media–Sharon Hill Line, are light rail lines operated by the Suburban Transit Division formerly known as the RED ARROW of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. The routes' eastern terminus is 69th Street Transportation Center in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania; Route 101 to Media, Route 102 to Sharon Hill. Altogether, the two lines operate on approximately of route.

Along with Norristown High Speed Line, formerly the Philadelphia and Western Railroad, the routes are the remaining lines of the Red Arrow Trolley System once operated by the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, (successor to the Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company); some local residents still call them "RED ARROW".

This route uses 29 Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company K cars, similar to those used on the SEPTA Subway–Surface Trolley Lines, but unlike them, the K cars on routes 101 and 102 are double-ended and use pantograph collection instead of trolley poles.

The 101 and 102 run together on their exclusive right-of-way from Upper Darby to Drexel Hill Junction for approximately , at which point they diverge.

Route 101 continues on its own right-of-way traveling west and southwest through Drexel Hill and Springfield with an important stop at the Springfield Mall before entering the street in Media. The 101 has double tracks to Woodland Avenue, then a single track to just before Pine Ridge, then enters the street at Providence Road in Media and runs on a single track the rest of the way. Cars in the street must yield to the trolley. Media is the only suburban town in the United States to have a trolley down the middle of its main street. The line terminates in the middle of the street just after the Delaware County Courthouse.

Route 102 runs southeast from Drexel Hill Junction through Drexel Hill and Clifton Heights and then goes into the street in Aldan. After Aldan, it returns to its own right-of-way, then passes through Collingdale before terminating at Chester Pike in Sharon Hill. The 102 has double tracks until up to North Street in Collingdale, where the 102 returns to its own right-of-way, and after North Street, there is a single track until the end of the line.

Springfield Road contains two stops along both lines. Route 101 stops at Springfield Road in Springfield. Route 102 stops at Springfield Road in Clifton Heights, then joins this street until it moves onto Woodlawn Avenue through Aldan.

 History 
The Sharon Hill Line (Route 102) was originally built by the Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company on March 15, 1906, and the Media Line (Route 101) was originally built by the same company on April 1, 1913. The lines were later bought by the Philadelphia Suburban Transit Company in 1954.

Besides Routes 101 and 102, there were also two other, now defunct, Red Arrow trolley lines. The direct ancestor of the SEPTA Route 104 bus line went to West Chester, splitting off from the rest of the system right after 69th Street Transportation Center onto West Chester Pike. The tracks continued all the way up West Chester Pike. West Chester trolleys were replaced by buses in 1954 due to widening of West Chester Pike; rush-hour trips to Westgate Hills lasted until 1958. Tracks remained in use for access to the Red Arrow's carbarn in Llanerch until SEPTA closed the barn in 1971; all tracks were soon removed except for a portion near 69th Street that SEPTA occasionally uses to store out-of service trolleys. The other now-defunct Red Arrow trolley line went to Ardmore until December 1966. It split from the West Chester line at Llanerch and continued on its own exclusive right-of-way. Much of the right-of-way still remains between Schauffele Plaza in Ardmore (the former terminus of the line) and Eagle Road in Havertown, although the tracks were removed and the right-of-way paved for dedicated use by the replacement bus line, now SEPTA Route 103. The 103 still uses this private right-of-way, although much of its other street routing has changed.
