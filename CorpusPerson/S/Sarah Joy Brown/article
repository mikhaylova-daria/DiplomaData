Sarah Joy Brown (born February 18, 1975) is an American actress. She is perhaps best known for originating the role of Carly Benson Corinthos, which she portrayed on the American daytime drama General Hospital from 1996 to 2001, and which earned her three Daytime Emmy Awards. In 2008, she returned to General Hospital in a different role, Claudia Corinthos. She exited General Hospital once again in 2009 and began appearing on The Bold and the Beautiful in the newly created role of Aggie Jones.

Brown appeared as Madison James on Days of Our Lives from October 2011 until the character's death in August 2012.

Life and career
Brown was born in Eureka, California, to David and Pamela Brown. She attended the Alexander Hamilton High School Academy of Music. Her acting career began at the age of 19, when she was cast as Kaitlin Star on Saban's syndicated action adventure science fantasy series, VR Troopers. In 1996, she made a guest appearance in a 3-part episode of Power Rangers Zeo playing Heather Thompson, a girl who has a crush on the Red Ranger's secret identity, Tommy Oliver, but it never leads anywhere. An article in FOX Kids Magazine claimed a member of the VR Troopers cast would be quitting the series to become a part of the Power Rangers cast, however the aforementioned Zeo three-parter and Hawkins voicing the Gold Ranger prior to the return of Austin St. John as Jason Lee Scott is the closest anything like this ever came to happening. 

In April 1996 Brown originated the role Carly Corinthos on the American ABC soap opera General Hospital. Brown "quickly became an overnight sensation" and received three Daytime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Carly. She won for Outstanding Younger Actress in 1997 and 1998, was nominated in 1999, and won again for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2000. In 2010, she received her first Daytime Emmy nomination in the Lead Actress category for her work as Claudia Zacchara. Brown appeared on the cover of Soap Opera Digest 19 times during her run in the role, and won two Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1998 (Younger Lead Actress) and 2000 (Favorite Actress). She departed the series in April 2001.

After leaving General Hospital, Brown guest-starred on several television series, including Crossing Jordan, Strong Medicine and Without a Trace. She returned to daytime in the role of Julia Morrisey Larrabee on As the World Turns from August 2004 to March 2005, in which she appeared in 109 episodes.

In 2004, Brown played the lead role of Kate Vignatti in the fact-based television movie The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story. She became a regular on the popular CBS crime drama Cold Case in the fall of 2005 but was let go after only a few months (she appeared in five episodes) with the series. In 2006, she starred in her first feature film, the comedy, Big Momma's House 2 and appeared in an episode of Monk the same year. Brown was also seen in the second season finale of The Closer and on a 2007 episode of the Fox police drama K-Ville.

Brown is a practicing convert to Judaism. She has one daughter, Jordan Alexandra Judith (b. July 20, 1998); the father is Brown's ex-fiancé, Israel composer Shuki Levy (a former executive producer on VR Troopers and the Power Rangers franchise). Brown has been diagnosed with Celiac Disease.
