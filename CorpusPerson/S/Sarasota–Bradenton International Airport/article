Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport is a public airport in Sarasota County (terminal) and Manatee County (airfield), Florida. Owned by the Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority, it is three miles north of Sarasota (Sarasota County) and six miles south of Bradenton (Manatee County).

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 657,157 enplanements in calendar year 2011, 2% less than in 2010.

Most airlines refer to the airport on destination maps and flight status displays as just "Sarasota", as that is the more widely known city. The airport is referred to locally as "SRQ" (the airport code). Much of the airport's airline service occurs during winter and spring, as the area is a popular tourist destination and home for snowbirds during winter and spring.

The airport's IATA airport code, "SRQ", is used as a shorthand nickname for the city of Sarasota and Sarasota area in general, as exemplified by media outlets like SRQ Magazine, WSRQ radio, and numerous local businesses in the area that include SRQ in their names.

History


SRQ's first airline was National, in 1947; the April 1957 OAG shows six departures a day. Eastern arrived a few years later and the airport's first jet flights were Eastern 727s in winter 1964–65 .

Air Force One was at the airport on September 11, 2001. George W. Bush was at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota when Andrew Card first informed him of the September 11, 2001 attacks at 9:05 AM. Bush returned to the airport. It taxied at 9:54 AM and lifted off at 9:55 AM flying first to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

Like many American airports, Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport experienced financial woes after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Two airlines at SRQ, Canada 3000 and Canadian Airlines, ceased operations, the first bankrupt and the second acquired by Air Canada.

In 2003 AirTran Airways began service as the result of a nationwide marketing poll sponsored by the airline. The poll indicated that Sarasota–Bradenton was one of several smaller airports that AirTran's customers would like the airline to serve. AirTran added service to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Baltimore–Washington International Airport, and by 2011 the airline served six U.S. cities non-stop from SRQ.

In September 2005 Delta Air Lines, the carrier with the largest market share out of SRQ, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. While initially there was concern regarding Delta's bankruptcy filing's effect on the financial stability of the airport, especially if Delta were to have reduced local operations, in fact Delta has since announced new service out of SRQ, with more flights to Atlanta and new service to New York LaGuardia Airport and Boston. All of that service was cut back or discontinued, but Delta recently announced new winter/spring seasonal service to Boston and LaGuardia.

In January 2012 AirTran Airways announced that it would drop SRQ on August 12, 2012 as part of its merger with Southwest.

 The "Q" in SRQ 
During the years before and after World War II, SRQ was known by its two-character designation, RS. By 1948, growth in aviation demand prompted IATA to coordinate the assignment of three-character codes. The airport initially received the designation "SSO", a short-lived designation, as it was subject to misinterpretation as the international distress signal, SOS. SRQ was chosen, with "Q" serving as filler text, in the same manner that "X" serves as the filler suffix for LAX.

 Governance 
The current President, CEO is Frederick "Rick" J. Piccolo. The airport is governed by the Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority. The board is made up of six governor appointed individuals, three from Sarasota County and three from Manatee County. The reason for the split is that the airport actually has portions in both counties.

Sarasota Bradenton International Airport covers 1,102 acres (446 ha) at an elevation of 30 feet (9 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 9,500 by 150 feet (2,896 x 46 m) and 4/22 is 5,009 by 150 feet (1,527 x 46 m).

In 2013 the airport had 103,411 aircraft operations, average 283 per day: 78% general aviation, 13% airline, 7% air taxi, and 2% military. 247 aircraft were then based at this airport: 69% single-engine, 14% jet, 13% multi-engine, and 4% helicopter.
