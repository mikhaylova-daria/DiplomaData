The Schools Spectacular is an Australian variety show featuring more than 3,000 students from across New South Wales and is performed annually at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Highlights of the Schools Spectacular are broadcast each year by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The actual performance is made up of many different pieces. A typical piece would have a spotlighted soloist singing on an elevated platform in the arena, surrounded by many dancers and actors. On the stage, the orchestra would be playing the instrumental part of the song while the choirs behind and next to the orchestra would be singing the chorus of the song. 

The first Schools Spectacular was Schools Spectacular 1983 and was intended to be a sound test for the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Since then, the Schools Spectacular has evolved significantly. The 2012 event included 3,600 students and 600 teachers from 400 schools in four performances viewed by 30,000 people.

Schools Spectacular is broadcast as a telecast with the highlights by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), and as a first, webcast through the Internet onto their website, with the help and sponsorhip by Cisco Systems. The Schools Spectacular is produced by 'The Arts Unit' of the New South Wales Department of Education and Training.

 Schools Spectacular 2008

The event has grown to be one of the biggest shows on earth, also published in Guinness World Records for over 10 years now as "the world's biggest variety show", and claimed by audiences across Australia as "the most heart-warming event of the year".
