is a Japanese light novel series by Ichiro Sakaki and illustrated by Yukinobu Azumi, also known as the popular adult dōjin artist Nakayohi Mogudan. In 2003, it was adapted into an anime series produced by Bones. The character designs in the anime are by Takahiro Komori, who is also known for the designs on another anime series, Cowboy Bebop.

Scrapped Princess is notable for high quality animation, its music, which is composed by Masumi Itō, and its themes. It begins as high fantasy and then quickly mixes into varying degrees of post-apocalyptic and science fiction elements through the application of Clarke's third law. The atmosphere has undertones of sadness, though many of the characters and situations are superficially light-hearted.

The anime is distributed in the United States by Bandai Entertainment. There is also a manga adaptation which has also been published in the US by Tokyopop. The manga is only three volumes, and has no plot overlap with the anime; the only things in common are the three main characters, the idea of the Scrapped Princess, and the Mauser Faith they are running from. Between May and November 2007 three of the original light novels have been translated into English by Tokyopop.

Story


The story takes place in what appears to be a fantasy world (revealed later to be Earth in the distant future) and revolves around a girl named Pacifica Casull, the sister in a pair of twins born to the royal family of a kingdom called Leinwan. Pacifica is abandoned at birth. The 5111th Grendel Prophecy predicts that she is the "poison that will destroy the world" if she reaches her sixteenth birthday. To prevent this, she is dropped off a cliff as an infant ("scrapped").

Pacifica is rescued by a court wizard and adopted by the commoner Casull family. Her foster siblings, Shannon, a swordsman, and Raquel, a wizard, become her protectors. Both siblings are extremely powerful and, more often than not, they easily break out of whatever difficult situation they face. Her siblings travel with her throughout most of the story, protecting her from the numerous attempts on her life by people who fear the outcome of the prophecy. Both siblings' skills see constant use. By contrast, Pacifica is mostly a typical fifteen-year-old and her inability to defend herself is a recurring source of self-doubt for her, as is the constantly repeated insistence that she will destroy the world. As the series progresses, the truth about the prophecy slowly comes to light, but even as more of the truth is revealed, more questions arise. Pacifica must discover her hidden destiny, as powerful beings called Peacemakers, who are worshipped in this world as demi-gods, continually manoeuvre to have her destroyed. At the same time, a mysterious being called a Dragoon comes to the aid of Pacifica and her guardians, offsetting the attack of the Peacemakers. It turns out that Pacifica is not "the poison that will destroy the world", but humanity's last hope, as part of a plan that was set in motion 5000 years before by scientists among the human resistance during what were called the Genesis Wars.

Before the Genesis Wars, the Peacemakers were created by humans as weapons against humanity's alien foes, but, determined to protect their human creators and prevent them from destroying themselves, the Peacemakers switched sides and assisted the aliens by imprisoning the survivors of the war in an artificial environment, while at the same time backing up their cultural development to the Middle Ages. The Peacemakers were able to do this with the help of a gifted psychic named Celia Mauser, who, like the Peacemakers themselves, had originally been a tool of the defense. Her powers were used to enhance humanity's weaponry, to the point where it was possible to predict enemy movements. The Peacemakers encouraged Celia Mauser to leak information to them in exchange for the lives of her brother and sister. She was too late; her siblings died, and Celia Mauser's treason was for nothing. Celia was then kept in an area of phase space in a sort of virtual reality for 5000 years, while humanity continued to live on unknowingly in an intangible cage, isolated on a single continent called Dusbin (literally, Dust bin). Her powerful mind was programmed into the artificial environment's control system, and the religion concocted by the aliens to control humanity worships her as a god.

For 5000 years, the Peacemakers watched over humanity, keeping cultural development at a standstill, and prepared to wipe out much of the human race if it ever showed any sign of stepping beyond its apportioned limits (as the Kingdom of Leinwan does toward the end of the series when the attempt is made to coerce the Peacemakers into helping them conquer the world). As the Peacemakers put it, "You don't know you are trapped if all you've ever known is your cage." Humans are completely incapable of resisting the will of the Peacemakers. Just looking at a Peacemaker in the eye renders a human obedient – even Shannon and Raquel are not immune to this. Pacifica Casull is the only human being in 5000 years who is immune to this control, and her ability will become communicable to others once she reaches her sixteenth birthday. This is why the Peacemakers are determined to destroy her, and why they have used the Grendel Prophecies to induce others to do the job for them, since Pacifica cannot be directly attacked by the Peacemakers. In the end, Pacifica's twin brother, Prince Forsyth, who has seen the suffering inflicted on his people by the Peacemakers in their attempts to eliminate Pacifica, asks to meet her. Her guardians allow it and he uses the opportunity to stab her in the back, ten hours before she turns sixteen. This causes her to be removed to the phase sphere, where she meets Celia Mauser and is given the choice of whether humanity will remain in their prison or not. Pacifica chooses freedom.

Timeline
Scrapped Princess takes place somewhere between the years 7000CE to 7500CE (8th millennium). In episode 13, it is discussed aboard the Skid that humankind is approximately at same progress level of the Middle Ages. It is also said the Middle Ages occurred 6,000 years ago. Considering the Middle Ages to be around 1000CE - 1500CE, 6000 years can be added onto that to get a rough estimate of the time frame. This also places the Genesis War between 2000CE and 2500CE (7500-5000=2500), since the Genesis War took place 5,000 years before the current date.

Glossary
Dragoon

Artificial intelligence weapon systems that were originally created to be used as combat weapons against an alien race by then-technologically superior humans. As a last resort, they were programmed to assist and protect the Providence Breaker (Scrapped Princess). Their strength and abilities are roughly equivalent to the Peacemakers but are used to attack the Providence system instead of protecting it. These weapon systems appear to have been around since the Genesis War as they mention they have been hiding from the Peacemakers (sleeping is the term used) for 5,000 years prior to the Providence Breaker's arrival. The Dragoons and the Peacemakers are very alike in personalities, looks and abilities.

5,000 years later, they were said to be the demons of Lord Browning, just like how Celia Mauser became Lord Mauser and the Peacemakers her apostles, when in reality both the Dragoons and Peacemakers are AIs created by the technologically superior humans of 5,000 years ago.

The Dragoons are ageless, and physical environments (in water, a vacuum etc.) do not affect them. They are able to levitate, go into the minds of humans, and teleport. When the Dragoons were first created, over 100 of them caused problems due to improper programming, which led to humans labeling them as troublemakers, and very few people trusted them. The Dragoons are also outwardly cold and unfeeling for humans, as they, like the Peacemakers, also comment on humans as being foolish, greedy creatures (in one episode, Natalie merely said that it could not be helped if 40000 people were to get killed), only to be used as tools to complete their mission.

The Dragoons, like their Peacemakers counterparts, do not feel many human emotions, such as fear and sadness, or see anything wrong in sacrificing many humans to protect the Providence Breaker. To them, as long as Pacifica manages to reach her 16th birthday, they will do anything at all costs to ensure it, just as the Peacemakers will do anything to stop Pacifica and the Dragoons from breaking the framework of the sealed world of Providence. However, some - like Zefiris - are different. She has more feelings, unlike the other Dragoons, who are cold and emotionless, and is often put into a moral dilemma on the methods, and wonders if they are too cruel and are sacrificing too many humans to achieve the goal of breaking the framework of the world of Providence. The Dragoons also have a true form, like the Peacemakers. In their true forms, the Dragoons turn into a large, powerful dragon.

The Dragoons that have appeared in the series are Zefiris, Gloria and Natalie.

There is a mythological depiction of the Genesis Wars on the wall in the Mauser church, where by which beings holding spears were seen descending from the skies onto what appears to be dragons. It actually depicts the brainwashed Peacemakers and the aliens fighting in the war against Mankind and their Dragoons.

Genesis War

Occurred 5000 years ago where humanity was in a massive war with alien intelligent life-forms. Instead of completely eliminating all of humanity, the aliens contact a human woman who betrays humanity in a desperate attempt to save her loved ones. This betrayal confines humanity to a contained world known as Dust Bin. It is not known whether there are humans that survived the Genesis War outside of the sealed world.

Guardian

Human beings with select genetic traits whereby they are able to draw on greater power to protect the Scrapped Princess, Pacifica (Providence Breaker). Several characters in the series possess this trait, including Shannon, Raquel, Leopold and Winia.

Mauser Faith

The predominant religion of the Scrapped Princess world. Used by Providence to maintain control of humanity as they believe the controlled world's system is the will of God. Lord Mauser (real name Celia Mauser) is in actuality the seer who betrayed humanity during the Genesis Wars and sealed them in this closed world to prevent the extinction of humanity. She did so in a desperate attempt to save her brother and sister but was too late as they both perished. Now, she runs the system and controls the fate of humanity. Celia's body and soul was maintained for 5000 years so she could run the system and give the Grendel Prophecies.

Peacemakers/Cosmos Guardians
A group of beings that have formidable powers and are supposedly the caretakers of the world. To the present humans, they were mainly known as cosmos guardians (or the Gods of the world). However, the Peacemakers are usually cruel, and have no qualms about killing humans. As Shannon said once to Cz: "You look like humans, walk and behave like humans, but you say cruel things which no human beings would ever say". They exist to maintain the Providence System at any cost.

The Peacemakers outward appearance is that of attractive-looking humans, but their personalities are usually sadistic. Their abilities are similar to the Dragoons, and they are ageless. Their predominant role is that of ceasing Pacifica's life, though they are unable to attack her directly, as that would cause Pacifica's latent ability of being able to destroy the Peacemakers to manifest itself. It is also mentioned that humans cannot oppose the wills of the Peacemakers/Cosmos Guardians, and that Pacifica is the only exception, as she is able to go against their wills.

The series also says that the Peacemakers operate in pairs. However, Cz, after experiencing many different events in her human form as a child, begins to sympathize with Pacifica and other humans, and to doubt her role as a cosmos guardian, wondering if what they, as the Peacemakers, are doing is right. Although she threatens to kill thousands of people per day at one point in the series, later on, she is accused/goaded by Steyr, another Peacemaker of having been "softened by the humans". Steyr goes on to taunt Cz by telling her that she "might as well go and live among them". The Peacemakers consist of civilian type and artillery type cosmos guardians, with the artillery types being the stronger of the two in terms of offensive power. Civilian types tend to prefer using manipulation and subterfuge to achieve their aims.

Originally, the Peacemakers, like the Dragoons, were created by humans as combat weapons, but were captured and reprogrammed by the aliens. The Peacemakers are actually Valkyrie Type: they are basically Dragoons, only they are independent systems—which backfired as that made it possible for the aliens to reprogram them, unlike the Dragoons who needed a D-knight to access such capabilities. However, Zefiris and Natalie are usually able to hold off the Peacemakers' attacks. The Peacemakers' most common attack is their 2nd Class Divine Punishment, where they transform into a larger form. They are however, not allowed to use their strongest attack: 1st Class Divine Punishment Manifestation, within the atmosphere for fear of damaging the controlled world of Providence. However, the Peacemakers do use it in episode 24 when the Dragoons and the Peacemakers are evacuated out of the controlled world into space during the final battle, just before Pacifica turns 16.

The known Peacemakers are Steyr, Shiizu/Cz (both are 'female' Peacemakers), Socom and Galil (Their male counterparts).

Phase Space

Apparently a pocket dimension that Dragoons and Peacemakers can escape to using some type of advanced technology. In episode 12 of the anime, Zefiris and Shannon escape to Phase Space after being overpowered by a powerful Peacemaker (Steyr/Stella). There are also times where the Dragoons and Peacemakers mention that they existed in Phase Space and were contained there.

Providence Breaker

The system that will terminate the controlled world and, in theory, free humanity from their unknowing prison. Also known as the Scrapped Princess. The Providence Breaker is also the only human who can defy the wills of the Cosmos Guardians. She can also destroy the proxies used to attack humans that are created by the Peacemakers.

Providence

The controlled world in which humans live and also the system which maintains it. The series suggests that humans are born with genetic information that allows the Peacemaker system and Providence rules to control them completely, thereby making any attempt to escape it impossible without the Scrapped Princess.

Dustvin

The continent on which humanity is contained is called "Dustvin", from the old language word for "garbage can" ("dust bin"). The old language is shown to be English.

Rally Point/Proxy

Typically referred to in the series as an amorphous creature that is made by Peacemakers out of organic matter (typically humans). The creature can absorb other living beings and add to its structure. The heart of the Rally Point is a blue energy-like crystal that controls it. There is also discussion about how the Scrapped Princess can be used as a Rally Point to prevent the Peacemakers from taking over the minds of humans. This suggests that Rally Points are magic focal points that can be used for other purposes.

Combat Weapon

Combat weapons consist of two types. The older versions are the Dragoons. Their newer counterparts are the Valkyrie Type, also called the Peacemakers. However the Peacemakers were brainwashed by an alien species that attacked Earth, and now serve as the prison guards of the sealed world: Providence. They seek to eliminate Pacifica as she has the power to go against their wills and break the framework of the sealed world.

Race of Evil

The alien race who were humanity's enemy during the genesis war. Unwilling to cause the extinction of humanity, they instead contacted Celia Mauser and helped her to confine humanity to the sealed continent of Dust-Bin, which they regarded as a "wildlife preserve" for humanity, where humanity could survive without posing a future threat to their race.
