Some Kind of Zombie is the fourth album released by Audio Adrenaline.

Concept

According to Audio Adrenaline, the album concept and its title song are based on the Scripture, specifically Colossians, Chapter 3, where it talks about "giving life over to God". The inspiration came from singer Mark Stuart's experience living with his missionary parents in Haiti, where voodoo is heavily practiced. According to Stuart, the message is that "you can be dead to your old self after becoming a new person through religion."

Recording

Some Kind of Zombie was recorded in 1997 at Ardent Recordings on Memphis and Shakin' Studios on Franklin. Recording was in charge of producer John Hampton, with Jason Latshaw and Matt Martone. Mixing was done by Skidd Mills. The album included a remix of the title song called "Some Kind of Zombie (Criscoteque Remix)", which was produced by Scott Humphrey. This track is not available on the audiocassette release of the album.
 A "Chevette (Remix)" can be found on the compilation album WoW 1999.

The album is the first album of the band without Barry Blair, although he collaborated in the writing of the title song, as well as recording the guitars to it. Blair was replaced by guitarist Tyler Burkum. It is also the first album to officially list Ben Cissell as the band's drummer. The song "Blitz" features members of Christian ska band The O.C. Supertones, including Matt Morginsky as a guest vocalist.
