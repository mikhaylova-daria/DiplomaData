St Mary MacKillop College, formerly known as MacKillop Catholic College, is a Catholic high school in the Australian capital of Canberra, with two campuses in the Tuggeranong Valley. The school is the result of an amalgamation of Padua High School and St. Peter's College in 1998. It is the largest school in Canberra. Mackillop College describes itself as a "dynamic and welcoming community where excellence in education is valued". Mackillop College accepts students from year 7 to 12. There are two campuses of St Mary MacKillop Catholic College, the junior campus (years 7 to 9) in Wanniassa and the senior campus (years 10 to 12) in Isabella Plains.

Administration
The College is divided into four houses for administration, pastoral care and extra curricular purposes. These houses - Mindygari, Meup Meup, Gurabang and Ngadyung - represent the four classical elements, with names derived from the language the Ngunnawal people, the local Aboriginal people.

The uniform of St Mary MacKillop College is primarily in the school colours navy, teal and white. Students wear a summer uniform in the first and fourth terms of the school year, and a winter uniform in the second and third terms. Students in years 11 and 12 wear a separate senior uniform. This senior uniform for girls is the same as the junior girls winter uniform, but with a green line on the collar. Senior girls only have one uniform and do not alternate in summer/winter. The senior boys uniform is the same as the junior boys uniform, except the shirts are blue instead of white, and there is a different tie.
