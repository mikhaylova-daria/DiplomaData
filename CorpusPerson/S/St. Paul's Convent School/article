School Hymn
Hark! Daughters of the great St. Paul,
Come listen to his call:
"O children of this loved school,
The loving nurse of all.
Rejoice in God, do work and pray.
Be true from day to day."
Beloved school of mine,
My pains and joys are thine.
My childhood's early dreams.
Are closely linked with thee.
The hope that heaven brings.
Thou dost unfold to me.
Thou dost unfold to me.

Sweet are the days of girlhood,
When friends we love and care.
Those golden links of childhood,
Whose sympathy we share.
Do stay and while the hours away
With us in work and play.
And when we leave.
Our dear old school,
These mem'ries we'll recall!
These mem'ries we'll recall!

Hark! Daughters of the great St. Paul,

Be true from day to day."
Beloved school of mine,
My pains and joys are thine.
My childhood's early dreams.
Are closely linked with thee.
The hope that heaven brings.
Thou dost unfold to me.
Thou dost unfold to me.

There is a swimming pool, library, laboratories and other facilities. In addition to that, there is a special room called "Classroom Of The Future". Each classroom is equipped with a computer running the Windows 7 operating system in order to assist teachers in their teaching.

Classroom of the Future
"Classroom of the Future" is located on the 7th floor of the new block (SIP). It provides Paulinians with an environment that is both functional and stimulating, and facilitates various patterns of group work that promote creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills for global learning.

The "Classroom Of The Future" is considered a "green classroom" despite its white furnishing. It has a computer with touch screen monitor and a glass board to be written on. There is a video camera for students to have video conference with overseas students, and a slanting window in the ceiling, in order to let the natural sunlight enter the classroom, which greatly increases the energy efficiency of the room. Also, the chairs in the room are specially designed so students can use the chair both as an armchair or as a writing desk.

Computer lab
The computer lab has imported Apple Macintosh computers. This room is frequently used by teachers and visitors for educational (Creative Media lessons) and advertising purposes. The school also makes extensive and valuable use of other Apple products such as iPod Touch, which teaches students more about the changing usage of technology.

Houses
Students in St. Paul's Convent School are separated into 6 "houses". In annual events like Sports Day and Swimming Gala, the six houses compete in cheering competitions and aim at achieving the Overall House Champion.

CAVELL (Blue) 
Named after Edith Louisa Cavell (1865–1915), a British nurse who became a celebrated martyr during World War I. Born in England, Cavell began her nursing career in 1895 at a London hospital. Later she became the first matron of the Berkendael Medical Institute in Brussels. In the course of her work there, Nurse Cavell helped British, French, and Belgian soldiers escape across the Dutch Frontier. For these activities, Edith Cavell was tried as a spy by the Germans and was executed.

KENNY (Green) 
Named after Elizabeth Kenny (1886–1952), the Australian nurse known for her technique of treating poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, Kenny developed a system of therapy, which was sometimes too elaborate, too extensive and too time-consuming. However, Elizabeth Kenny did manage to draw attention to poliomyelitis as a national problem. In 1942, the "Elizabeth Kenny Institute" was founded in Minnesota, U.S.A. Sister Kenny can be regarded as the Florence Nightingale of Orthopedies.

CURIE (Yellow) 
Named after Marie Skłodowska Curie (1867–1934). With the help of her husband, a French chemist, Pierre Curie, the couple discovered the twin of polonium, radium. Marie Curie was the only person to have received two Nobel Prizes once in 1903 and in 1911. Marie Curie founded the Paris Institute of Radium, and was appointed its director by the French government. Madame Curie became a victim of leukemia, which was caused by long periods of exposure to radiation.

KELLER (Red) 
Named after Helen Adams Keller (1880–1968), an American author and educator of the blind. From infancy, Keller was without power of speech and was also deaf and blind. With the inestimable assistance of Anne M. Sullivan, Keller learnt to read and to write by Braille; to use a typewriter; and even to speak, and eventually mastered five languages. Upon graduating with honours from Radeliffe, she began to lecture extensively on the education of the blind; and has received many honours for achievement. Helen Keller greatly furthered the work of the "Foundation of the Blind".

MASON (Orange) 
Named after Charlotte Mason (Marie Shew) 1842-1923, an educationalist whose philosophy influences much on the best practice of modern primary schools. She believes in the response of all children to all living ideas presented in a literary form. Children must enjoy their lessons. The desire to know should be the only motivation. She also appreciates the importance of parental involvement to the child's confidence and progress. She founded the Parents' Union School, a correspondence school that became widespread in England. The demand for governess to implement her methods caused her to train young women and to raise their status by insisting on adequate salaries and conditions of work. These students were trained in her Ambersice home, now the Charlotte Mason College.

MORRIS (Purple) 
Named after Margaret Morris (1891–1980), a dancer who was born in London. She had no formal academic education but went to dancing classes where she soon rebelled against classical ballet and composed exercises of her own. She adapted the six classical Greek dance positions as the basis of her own system of movement. In 1915 she started the Margaret Morris Club which became a center for discussion and the presentation of creative ideas. She extended her exercises into sports training, remedial movement for the handicapped and school education. Her overall influence was immense on modern practice of physical education, on remedial work and in choreographic innovation.

Extracurricular activities
Students participate in various extracurricular activities and competitions. For example, the annual Inter-class English and Chinese debate competitions, dance competition and the annual Music Talent Quest (MTQ). There are also 55 extracurricular clubs, societies, voluntary service units and interest groups for students to join and explore their interests and talents. There are also exchange programs with schools of foreign countries, such as trips to Beijing, Stanford University, Sichuan, Spain and France.

The SPCS dance club consists of oriental dance team, western dance team, modern dance team and Chinese dance team. The dance teams are renowned for their excellence. The choreographer and dance mistress of the dance teams is Miss Eileen Lee.

The 2 SPCS dance teams perform in various occasions, such as the opening of 2008 Beijing Olympics equestrian competitions that was held in Hong Kong. Each team has about 20 dancers which were selected through auditions held around September by committee members. Dancers receive training once or twice a week, each ranging from 1–2 hours. Extra trainings are often organized before competitions.
