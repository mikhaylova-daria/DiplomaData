(the best of) NewOrder (or The Best of New Order) is a compilation album by English band New Order. It was released in the United Kingdom in November 1994 by London Records and, with a different track listing, in the United States on 14 March 1995 by Qwest Records and Warner Bros. Records. The cover and liner notes - on the U.S. CD at least - give the group's name as one word (NewOrder) instead of the usual New Order.

 Background 
(the best of) New Order is the second compilation album released by the group and follows their first, the hugely successful Substance album by seven years. The group had taken a hiatus due to tensions and disputes during the recording and touring of their 1993 album, Republic. Republic had been the first album that the group had released for London Records, and with the group announcing little intention of working together the label went ahead compiling (the best of) New Order.

The compilation primarily consists of seven-inch mixes of the group's singles from 1985 onwards. New versions of "True Faith", "Bizarre Love Triangle", "1963" and "Round & Round" appear in alternative mixes. The collection also includes one non-single track, "Vanishing Point" (from the LP Technique), though this was made famous as the theme tune to the BBC series Making Out. Only "Thieves Like Us" (the oldest track included, dating from 1984) appears in the same form as on the earlier compilation, Substance. The liner notes (first on a New Order album) were provided by Paul Morley.

The US version of the album omits three tracks ("The Perfect Kiss", "Shellshock" and "Thieves Like Us"), but adds one track from each of New Order's first three albums ("Dreams Never End" from Movement, "Age of Consent" from Power, Corruption & Lies, and "Love Vigilantes" from Low-Life), and a previously unreleased vocal version of a track from the 1987 film soundtrack Salvation!, "Let's Go (Nothing for Me)".

The following year, the remix album The Rest of New Order was released, with similar cover art.

 Release and reception 


(the best of) New Order was released on CD, cassette, double LP, VHS and Laserdisc. Limited editions bundled together the cassette and CD in a box set. Video and Laserdisc versions included singles that do not appear on other versions, namely "Confusion", "State of the Nation" and "Spooky". Although he felt it is not as good a compilation as Substance (1987), AllMusic's William Ruhlmann viewed the album as an exceptional overview of New Order's 1980s and early 1990s music. In his review for The Village Voice of the US edition, Robert Christgau said that the album shows why he prefers Bernard Sumner's impassive quality over the despairing Ian Curtis:



The album sold well in the Christmas market and reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart, and was certificated Platinum by the BPI. The compilation did well internationally, charting at #30 in Australia, No. 23 in Canada, and #78 in the US.

"True Faith-94" and "1963" were released as singles to promote the compilation. "True Faith-94" was released in November 1994, and reached #9 in the UK and #11 in Ireland. "1963" (dubbed "1963–95") was remixed by Arthur Baker in a guitar-driven arrangement and released the following January; it reached #21 in the UK and #29 in Ireland.

The unusual shape on the album cover is a stylised question mark, indeed, sometimes in chart books, the album is listed as ? (The Best of) New Order.
