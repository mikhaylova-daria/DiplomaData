The Ozzman Cometh is a compilation album by Ozzy Osbourne released in 1997. It is his third greatest hits collection. Its initial, limited edition 2-CD pressing contained five previously unreleased songs. Versions released in 2002 and later copies of this compilation have only one disc, and "Shot in the Dark" is replaced by "Miracle Man". This was due to a legal action brought about by the song's co-writer, Phil Soussan, for unpaid royalties.

Note on versions post-2002: The album tracks are from the 2002 remasters, for which Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman were partially re-recorded. The original drum and bass tracks were replaced with recordings by Osbourne's then-current bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin, as a management response to legal action by original bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake for unpaid royalty fees. Note also the deliberate misspelling of Daisley's and Soussan's names in this CD's sleeve notes: 'Bob Daisy', 'Bill Susan', as well as Rudy Sarzo's - 'Trudy Sarzo.'
The tracks from Bark at the Moon are the original recordings, but are later mixes of the songs.

The compilation won a 1997 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for Best Hits or Compilation Album.

The interview found on this disc is from 1988 where Osbourne is interviewed about his latest album at the time (No Rest For The Wicked) and some other topics about his new guitarist, Zakk Wylde and his past days on Black Sabbath.

The tracks "Black Sabbath", "War Pigs", "Fairies Wear Boots", and "Behind the Wall of Sleep" are taken from a session for the BBC's John Peel Sunday Show dated 4.26.70. "Fairies Wear Boots" and "War Pigs" are early versions of tracks that would finally be recorded on the Paranoid album and thus have different lyrics.
