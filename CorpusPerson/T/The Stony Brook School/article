The Stony Brook School (SBS) is a private independent Christian boarding and college preparatory school for boys and girls in grades 7 to 12. It is located in Stony Brook on the north shore of Long Island, New York. It was founded by the Rev. Dr. John F. Carson and fellow members of the Stony Brook Assembly in 1922. Its founding headmaster was Frank E. Gaebelein.

History
In 1906, a group of Presbyterian ministers and laymen began an enterprise to form an annual series of summer Bible conferences in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These conferences were to be in the tradition of other Bible conferences already established at Chautauqua, New York, Winona Lake, Indiana, and Northfield, Massachusetts.
The group was led by the Rev. John Fleming Carson, pastor of the former Central Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn and later Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly (1911). After having visited the hamlet of Stony Brook in 1907, Carson and his associates settled on a location directly across from the train station. The first summer conference of the Stony Brook Assembly began on July 3, 1909 and was a success. The Stony Brook Assembly was formally incorporated by the state of New York in 1914.

Carson's vision also included the establishment of a boys' school which could use the Assembly grounds outside of the summer months. As early as 1916, formal plans were being considered for opening the school, but financial constraints and World War I postponed the opening of the school until the fall of 1922. On September 13, The Stony Brook School was inaugurated with 27 boys and 9 faculty. Founding headmaster Frank E. Gaebelein called the new school an "experiment" in Christian education and set the mission for the school as being a rigorous college preparatory school thoroughly rooted in the Christian tradition. Education was not merely an emphasis on strong academics for the education of the mind, but more importantly was an emphasis on building character for the education of the heart - a distinction he linked with an adherence to the gospel. In his report to the Board in November 1937, Gaebelein reaffirmed the purpose of the school stating, “It was never the aim of Dr. Carson and the other founders, however, simply to inaugurate one more college preparatory school. Stony Brook’s prime reason for existence has been to bring its students into vital contact with the Christian faith.”

The academic reputation of the school grew in prominence. In May 1923, it was granted a charter by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. In 1928, the school was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.
In 1930, SBS was granted a charter by the Cum Laude Society, placing it among the first sixty schools granted this distinction since 1906.
In 1931, the Director of Admissions at Princeton University indicated that the admissions committee was so impressed with the caliber of Bible study at Stony Brook that it would award one Carnegie Unit of preparation for college.

In the fall of 1971, a group of thirty day-student girls entered the school, beginning the school's move toward co-education. The following year, female boarding commenced.

In honor of the school's fiftieth anniversary in 1972, long-time faculty member and writer D. Bruce Lockerbie penned a history of the school entitled, The Way They Should Go.

In the past two decades, new and upgraded facilities which have included three new residence halls, a stadium, an all-weather track, and a baseball field, as well six major renovations all totalling over $10,000,000, have raised the caliber of academics, athletics, and community life - the capstone of which will be the completion of
a new dining hall and student center.

Leadership Program
As part of the School's mission to train leaders of character, a comprehensive leadership program trains students emphasizing servant leadership and provides numerous leadership opportunities in the School community.

Some of the many leadership positions include workjob captains, team captains, class representatives, dining hall maitre d's, committee and council members, and the Prefect Board composed of fifteen seniors.

Honor Code
The School has adopted an Honor Code which emphasizes honesty and integrity, as well as the virtues of respect, responsibility, and servanthood. Students promise not to lie, intentionally deceive, cheat, or steal. By daily upholding this code, they contribute to an atmosphere of trust among the members of the School community.

The Honor Code reinforces the utmost importance of: respect for one's own person, respect for other people in the community, and respect for the property of the school and the property of others.

Prior to the beginning of every new school year, every student must re-read and sign it. The Honor Code is upheld by the Honor Board composed of five seniors and two juniors. It is led by the Head Prefect and is advised by the Director of Student Life. The members of the Board are elected by their peers and the faculty for their integrity and example of character within the community. If a student is suspected to have violated the Honor Code, he or she is summoned to an Honor Code hearing, where he or she is questioned by the Board. The student may bring an adult advocate who can speak about his or her character. After hearing the case, the Board deliberates and recommends an appropriate disciplinary action to the administration.

Traditions
*Chapel is one of the most important Stony Brook traditions incorporated into the day. It is held Monday-Thursday for the student body where the faculty expound on the lectionary readings for the week. Thursday chapel is a longer worship service which frequently includes outside speakers. Chapel is also held on Sunday mornings for the residential school community.

*The "Workjob" Program has been a large part of school life since 1942. Because of the labor shortage produced during WWII, the students were given a chore that helped to maintain the running of the campus, ranging from sweeping classrooms and washing dishes to shoveling coal for the furnaces.

*The first weekend of every new school year and after spring break, the six classes compete against each other in an evening of field games called Class Challenges for the prestige being the top class. Dorm Challenges are also held between dorms, which are paired up into teams and compete for the House Cup.

*In early November after the end of the fall athletic season, the school community takes part in the Gingerbread Bread Run, a 1.8 mile run, organized by the prefects, which rounds the perimeter of the campus and the athletic field. The reward after the race is a gingerbread bear cookie and hot chocolate.

*The annual Declamation Contest, in November, is held where twelve finalists compete by performing 4-5 minute pieces in the categories of Oration, Drama, and Humor. Upperclassman are required to select a declamation each October for their English classes and are narrowed down to semi-finalists in November. Cash prizes of $100 are awarded to the winner of each category. The Middle School Declamation Contest is held separately each Spring.

*Prior to the end of the semester in December, the school community celebrates Christmas with a service of Lessons and Carols, based on the service that originated at Kings College at Cambridge University in England. The service combines the retelling of the redemption story with congregational carols and musical performances by the Concert Choir, Chamber Singers, and Chamber Orchestra. The service is followed by a special Christmas dinner and dessert buffet in the Dining Hall.

*International week in late January and the International Festival is a favorite highlight for the school community every year. A week of internationally themed meals, chapels, and assemblies concludes with an evening featuring buffets of authentic international cuisines from our diverse student body and a program of dances, skits, and songs sharing their native cultures.

*Similar to the service of Lessons and Carols, the school has a tenebrae Maundy Thursday service prior to Easter weekend in order to commemorate Christ's death on Good Friday.

*On Commencement, it is also a tradition for the graduates and all of the faculty in their regalia to process up Chapman Parkway and down to Swanson behind bagpipers prior to the ceremony. The commencement luncheon for all guests follows the ceremony.
