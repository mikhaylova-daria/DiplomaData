Thiago Motta is a professional footballer who plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. mainly as a central midfielder.

He spent his early career at Barcelona, where he was injury-prone. He also played two and a half seasons with Internazionale, winning 11 major titles between the two clubs combined.

Born in Brazil, Motta is also a citizen of Italy due to his ancestry. He represented the latter national team since 2011, appearing at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup and finishing second in the first tournament.

Club career
Barcelona
Born in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, Motta signed with FC Barcelona in 1999 at age 17, from local Clube Atlético Juventus, initially being assigned to the club's B-side. He eventually graduated to the first team in 2001, making his official debut on 3 October against RCD Mallorca in a 3–0 home win.

In the 2001–02 edition of the UEFA Champions League, Motta made seven appearances and helped his team to the semi-finals. In the 2002–03 season in La Liga, he appeared in a career-best 21 games (with three goals) as Barça could only finish in sixth position, and also played an important part in the following season's long UEFA Cup run, which was eventually ended by Celtic; in the first leg, a 0–1 loss in Glasgow (0–1 on aggregate), he was sent off during half-time after hitting out at opposing goalkeeper Robert Douglas, who was also shown the red card, in an incident that happened in the tunnel.

Motta was also dogged by several injuries, particularly one suffered on 11 September 2004 against Sevilla FC, which sidelined him for seven months, during his time at Barcelona. He would eventually need surgery to rebuild the anterior cruciate and lateral ligaments in his left knee, but was able to make a swift recovery and made an emotional comeback, taking to the field to rapturous applause as eventual league champions defeated Getafe CF 2–0 on 17 April.

Atlético Madrid
In late August 2007 Motta signed a one-year contract with Atlético Madrid, for an undisclosed fee. Once again he began the season on the sidelines, injured; in the Copa del Rey quarterfinal match against Valencia CF he was ejected after only 25 minutes, and the Colchoneros lost the away fixture 0–1 and subsequently the tie.

Due to injury to regular starter Raúl García and the departure of Maniche in January 2008, Motta's opportunities increased. In March, however, the recurrent knee problems reappeared, and his season was over, followed by a successful surgery and rehabilitation in the United States; following his release he trialed with Premier League side Portsmouth, but did not sign for the club.

Italy
In September 2008 Motta joined Genoa C.F.C. on a free transfer, after passing a medical. During his debut campaign he performed consistently well and was a regular in the starting eleven, under coach Gian Piero Gasperini.

On 11 April 2009, Motta scored two goals (one of them in the first half's injury time) in a final 3–2 home win over Juventus FC. He finished the year with a career-best six goals, and his club qualified for the Europa League.

On 20 May 2009 La Gazzetta dello Sport confirmed that Motta, alongside teammate Diego Milito were transferred to Inter Milan. Inter paid €28 million for Milito and €10.2 million for Motta, while as part of the deal, Genoa received five Inter players: Robert Acquafresca, Francesco Bolzoni, Leonardo Bonucci, Ivan Fatic and Riccardo Meggiorini; Motta's agent Dario Canovi later revealed that his Genoa contract with the club included a buy-out fee of €10 million.

Motta's debut came in the 2009–10 season's opener, a 1–1 home draw against A.S. Bari, and his first goal came the next round as he opened the scoresheet in the Derby della Madonnina after an assist by Milito, as Inter defeated A.C. Milan 4–0. Having been in and out of the team for the duration of the campaign, he netted his first brace for Inter in a 3–0 win against Bologna F.C. 1909 on 3 April 2010.

Motta also appeared in eight games during the club's victorious Champions League campaign, including the 0–1 loss at former side Barcelona for the semifinals (3–2 aggregate win). During that match, he was sent off after apparently striking Sergio Busquets in the face with his hand; the incident gathered attention due to Busquets' apparent feigning of injury. 

On 23 October 2011, from a corner taken by Wesley Sneijder, Motta scored through a header in a 1–0 win against A.C. Chievo Verona, which was Inter's first home win in 2011–12.

Paris Saint-Germain
On 31 January 2012, in spite of Inter manager Claudio Ranieri indicating shortly before he was confident the player would remain with the club until the end of the season, having called him to the upcoming league match against U.S. Città di Palermo, Motta signed with Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in France, for a fee believed to be around €10 million. Following his move, he revealed that he dreamt of playing for the club ever since fellow Brazilians such as Raí, Leonardo and Ronaldinho shone in the French capital; he also revealed that he was not happy at Inter, refusing to further elaborate on his reasons to leave.

Four days after signing for the club, Motta made his debut for PSG, against Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. in a 3–1 home win, being booked in the process. On 22 April 2012, in another home fixture, he scored his first goal in Ligue 1, contributing to a 6–1 victory over FC Sochaux-Montbéliard.

On 21 February 2014, aged 31, Motta extended his contract until June 2016. In August, he was left with a broken nose after being headbutted by SC Bastia's Brandão in the tunnel, as his opponent went on to be suspended for six months.

International career
Motta made his debut for Brazil in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Although he played with the U-23 team, it was a full international competition, hence the international cap gained was fully recognized by FIFA; he went on to appear in another two games in the tournament, and previously represented the nation at the 1999 South American Under-17 Football Championship.

Motta missed the 2004 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament due to injuries, but appeared for the U23 team in November 2003 against Santos FC. Subsequently, there were claims that he wanted to be called up for Italy and possibly to the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as he possessed dual nationality – his paternal grandfather being Italian. FIFA granted players to have one chance to change their representing nation if they had dual nationality, but not for players who have already played in a competitive "A" match (non-friendly).

On 6 February 2011 Motta received his first call-up from Italy, for a friendly against Germany, but an official statement from the Italian Football Federation declared it subject to FIFA clearance, which was granted two days later; he was replaced in the 63rd minute of the 1–1 draw by Alberto Aquilani.

On 25 March 2011, in only his second international, a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier in Slovenia, Motta scored the game's only goal, following a 73rd-minute combination with Federico Balzaretti. He was selected to the finals in Poland and Ukraine, starting in three group stage matches for the Azzurri and adding two substitute appearances, against Germany in the semifinals (2–1 win) and Spain in the final: in the decisive match, after having again replaced Riccardo Montolivo, in the 55th minute, he suffered an hamstring injury after only five minutes and had to be himself carried off, leaving his team with ten players – he was the third player brought in by manager Cesare Prandelli – in an eventual 0–4 loss.

Motta was named in a 30-man provisional squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup on 13 May, and also made the final list. He played his first-ever game in the tournament at the age of nearly 32, coming on in the 57th minute of the 2–1 group stage win over England.
