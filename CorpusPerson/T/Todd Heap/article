The Baltimore Ravens selected Heap with the 31st overall pick in the 2001 NFL Draft. Through the end of the 2009 NFL season he has played 120 total career games, starting 115.

Heap recorded 16 receptions for 206 yards and one touchdown in his rookie season, playing behind eight-time Pro-Bowler Shannon Sharpe. He became the starting tight end for the Ravens in 2002 after Sharpe left in free agency. The Ravens were 7-9 in Heap's second season. He caught 68 passes for 836 yards and 6 touchdowns and was voted to his first Pro Bowl. The following season in 2003, Heap garnered 57 receptions for 693 yards and 3 touchdowns, despite the Ravens having a run-first offense, behind the record breaking 2066-yard rushing season of Jamal Lewis. Heap was again voted to the Pro Bowl as the Ravens won the AFC North division for the first time. Heap had 6 receptions for 80 yards and a touchdown in a 20-17 playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans. 
Heap was injured in the second week of the 2004 season, in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He returned in week 13, but missed the final game of the season. He finished the season with 303 yards and 3 touchdowns in six games. He returned healthy and ready to play in the 2005 season. The Ravens team suffered numerous injuries to their starters and ended the season 6-10. Heap caught 75 passes for 855 yards and 7 touchdowns.

2006 would see him receiving passes from former rival, former Pro Bowl QB Steve McNair. 2006 would also prove to be the Ravens best regular season, as they won the AFC North for the second time in franchise history with a record of 13-3. Heap caught 73 passes for 765 yards and 6 touchdowns. Heap missed 10 games in the 2007 season due to injury, and caught only 23 passes, amassing 239 yards and one touchdown. In 2008, he collected 35 receptions for 403 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Ravens advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the first time since the 2000 season, but would lose to the Steelers.

Heap played through numerous injuries in the 2009 season, yet had 53 receptions for 593 yards and 6 touchdowns, and twice scored two touchdowns in a single game. The Ravens finished 9-7, losing in the second round of the playoffs to the Indianapolis Colts. He built on his success from the previous year in 2010, going on to have one of the best seasons of his career. In 12 games, he notched 37 receptions for 546 yds. and 5 TDs, one being a career long 65 yd. TD. In a week 13 Sunday Night Football match-up with the Steelers, he suffered a pulled hamstring on the first offensive snap for Baltimore, taking him out of the game. As a precaution, he has missed the 3 weeks, not wanting to re-aggravate or worsen the injury.

On July 25, 2011, the day the NFL announced the CBA, the Ravens announced they would be releasing him once free agency begins. He was officially released on July 28.

Arizona Cardinals
On July 31, 2011 Heap signed a two-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals. Heap appeared in 12 games for the Cardinals, totaling 32 receptions for 377 yards and 1 touchdown. After being injured in a Week 2 game against the New England Patriots on September 16th, 2012 late in the 3rd quarter, he did not return for the remaining 11 weeks afterwards and was eventually released by the Cardinals on December 4, 2012.

Retirement
Heap retired from professional football in 2013. On May 13, 2014 the Baltimore Ravens announced Heap would be inducted into the team's Ring of Honor.
