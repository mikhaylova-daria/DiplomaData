The 250 member UCLA Bruin Marching Band, known as The Solid Gold Sound, represents the University at major athletic and extracurricular events. During the fall marching season, the Band performs at the Rose Bowl for UCLA Bruin home football games. Pregame shows by the Band aim to build crowd energy and enthusiasm with traditional UCLA songs like Strike Up the Band for UCLA, Sons of Westwood and The Mighty Bruins. Throughout the game, the Band performs custom-arranged rock and pop songs, as well as the traditional fight songs and cheers of the University. The UCLA Varsity Band appears at basketball games and other athletic contests in Pauley Pavilion.

The UCLA Band program, which includes the Marching and Varsity Bands, the Wind Ensemble and the Symphonic Band, is in the School of the Arts and Architecture's Department of Music, part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music www.schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/index.php. Band appearances at athletic events are funded primarily by student registration fees, a direct allocation from the Chancellor's Office and the Solid Gold Sound Club. 

The 1993 UCLA marching band was awarded The Sudler Trophy, an award bestowed on one university marching band every year. Described by a Los Angeles Times reporter as "The Heisman Trophy of the collegiate band world",8 the award does not represent the winner of any championship, but rather a band surrounded by great music and tradition that has become respected nationally.

The tenorline plays on 6 drum multi-toms using MT1A Tenor Mallets by Vic Firth. The snareline plays using Ralph Hardimon sticks by Vic Firth.

Note that the UCLA Marching Band currently does not march Baritones or Baritone Saxophones, although marching baritone horns and before that, bell front euphoniums had been a component in the past.

Style
The UCLA Marching Band marches in a Drum corps style with low mark times and glide steps. Field formations include fast moving precision drill progressions, letter blocks, pictures, concert arcs, and the famous Cursive UCLA formation. The band does many different styles of shows, depending upon the occasion. 

The exception to the drum corps marching style is the traditional pregame "run-on" where the band rapidly high-steps onto the field into the block letter U-C-L-A formation.

History
In 1925, at the Vermont avenue campus, The UCLA Marching Band originated as a 50-piece ROTC unit under the direction of W.G. Powell. The band was part of the welcoming group when John Philip Sousa visited Los Angeles in 1928, and were directed by Sousa in the performance of Stars and Stripes Forever. At that time, the director was Ben Laietsky, a member of Sousa's band. The band remained a military group until 1934. In 1935, under the direction of Leroy Allen, the group became an integral part of campus life, providing music at rallies and games. The original uniforms were military style, with military caps and waist-length capes.

Under directors C. B. Hunt and Patton McNaughton, the band increased in size to 128 members by 1947.

Clarence Sawhill and Kelly James 1952-1982
In 1952, Clarence Sawhill www.uclaband.com/about/sawhill/index.htm became director of Bands. F. Kelly James content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docIdhb4d5nb20m&doc.viewframes&chunk.iddiv00076&toc.depth1&toc.id= became the director of the marching band, a position he would hold until suffering a stroke at the UCLA-Cal football game in 1980. Sawhill and James grew the UCLA band program to include a 100 piece Concert Band, an 80 piece Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a 144-piece Marching Band, and a 60 piece Varsity Band.

In the 1950s the UCLA Marching Band uniforms were gold/yellow jackets with navy blue pants, blue shakos and white shoes. The band marched in a military style. The band appeared in color on the cover of the November 26, 1956 issue of Sports Illustrated. It is one of the few so honored beginning with the University of Oklahoma marching band (1954), the Princeton University Band (1955), and later, The Ohio State University Marching Band (1958). This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine. But it is usually not listed along with the other cover appearances by UCLA athletes. (As of 2006, UCLA athletes have appeared on 105 covers, the most of any university and also any sporting organization.) 

In the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the Queen's Guard. The band had a similar marching style, including the distinctive arm swinging, but also having the high "chair" step. The uniform pants were school colors blue and black trim, and imitation Bearskin (or tall Busby) hats. In the early 1960s, the uniform coats were gold. later the uniform coats were dark blue. The shoes were black with white spats.

In 1961, the Band made a European Tour which included performances in Denmark, France, Austria, Germany, England and Switzerland.

In 1972, women were admitted to the UCLA Band, as well as other college marching bands around the country as a response to the Title IX educational amendment. Many marching bands, including the UCLA Band, had women members or a women's auxiliary unit during World War II, but the bands gradually became all-male organizations after the war.

In 1973, the band wore gold jackets, navy blue pants, navy blue turtleneck sweaters, and no hat, for one game. They were never used after that.

In 1977, the school purchased new uniforms that were royal blue with yellow trim. The large overcoats had a white front with block vertical UCLA letters. There were tall white plush busby hats with blue and yellow plumes.

Dr. Thomas Lee and Gordon Henderson

In 1985, the band got newly designed uniforms, in the current military style. These uniforms were designed with band member input to replace the brightly colored 1977 uniforms. The uniforms consisted of navy blue wool trousers and coat with trim of orange-yellow (California poppy-colored) and white, knee-length, orange-yellow capes on the left shoulder. The shoes were changed to white. White gloves were standard as well. The large bearskin hats were replaced by Shako hats with white 12" feather plumes. An all-powder blue uniform was prototyped, but rejected in favor of the navy blue. The color guard did wear powder blue uniform coats and skirts similar in style to the new uniforms for two years.

In 2007 the band was outfitted with new uniforms at the USC game. The coats are now the official "True Blue" color adopted by UCLA in 2004. Other elements from the 1985 uniforms were retained.

In 1985, Dr. Thomas Lee came from the University of Texas to be the Director of Bands and Director of the Wind Ensemble.

The UCLA Bruin Marching Band was the 1993 recipient of the Sudler Trophy, presented by the John Philip Sousa Foundation in recognition of the Band's tradition of excellence and innovation.

Fifty members of the Band, along with six members of the UCLA Dance Team, performed in the www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/showtime/mega/cnyc/night_parade.jhtml Chinese New Year Day Parade in Hong Kong in January 2006. The Band spent six days exploring the city and performing at several venues. The parade was broadcast live all over the Asian continent. The Band returned to Hong Kong in 2008 to perform at this same event.

Fourteen members of the UCLA Drumline traveled to Nagoya, Japan from May 1 to 7, 2010, to perform at the 27th Annual Ekitopia Festival Parade. They also took a sightseeing trip to Kyoto while they were there.

The band became part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music www.schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/index.php in 2007 when the departments of Music, Ethnomusicology and Musicology were combined. Musician and recording executive Herb Alpert gave $30 million to UCLA in November 2007, the single largest individual gift to music higher education in the western United States.

Dr. Lee retired from UCLA in 2012.
