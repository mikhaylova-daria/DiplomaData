Synopsis
Under One Roof follows the lives of three generations of a middle class African American family sharing a two-family house in Seattle, Washington. The lower unit is occupied by family patriarch Nesbit "Neb" Langston (Jones), a recently widowed police officer who has adopted a troubled 16-year-old foster child, Marcus Henry (Merlin Santana). Neb's daughter 25-year-old Ayesha (Monique Ridge) also lives with them.

The upper unit is occupied by Neb's adult son Ron (Morton), his wife and his children. Ron is a former Marine who is attempting to deal with the stress of opening his own business. Meanwhile, Ron's wife Maggie (Calloway) is having reservations about re-entering the workforce after being a stay-at-home mom for the couple's two children, son Derrick (Ronald Joshua Scott), a ten-year-old diabetic, and 15-year-old daughter Charlie (Essence Atkins). 

The series, which was a midseason replacement for CBS, was cancelled after six episodes.
