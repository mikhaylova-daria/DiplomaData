Subcommittees
Due to its relatively small size, the House Administration Committee has not had subcommittees for most of its existence. For the 110th Congress, Chairwoman Millinder-McDonald recommended the creation of two new subcommittees, which were approved by the full committee on February 16, 2007. However, in the 113th Congress, the committee abolished both subcommittees.

History
The Committee on House Administration was created by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which merged the Committees on Enrolled Bills (created in 1789 as Joint Committee), Elections (created in 1794), Accounts (created in 1803), Printing (created in 1846), Disposition of Executive Papers (created in 1889), Memorials (created in 1929), and some functions of the Joint Committee on the Library (created in 1806 as a Joint Committee) into one new standing committee, the Committee on House Administration. (See National Archives's www.archives.gov/legislative/guide/house/chapter-12.html Records of the House Administration Committee and Its Predecessors)

In 1975 its responsibilities expanded to include oversight of parking facilities and campaign contributions to House candidates. In 1995 its responsibilities expanded to include oversight of the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards.
