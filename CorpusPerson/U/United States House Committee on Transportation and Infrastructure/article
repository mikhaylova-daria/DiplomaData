The U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is a standing committee of the United States House of Representatives.

History
The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has formerly been known as the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, and the Committee on Public Works between 1947 and 1968. This committee was formed in 1842.

Under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 the Committees on Public Buildings and Grounds (1837-1946), Rivers and Harbors (1883-1946), Roads (1913–46), and the Flood Control (1916–46) were combined to form the Committee on Public Works. Its jurisdiction from the beginning of the 80th Congress (1947–48) through the 90th Congress (1967–68) remained unchanged.

While these four original committees retained their separate identities, they were reduced to subcommittees. Addition subcommittees were formed for issues on Beach Erosion, 80th Congress (1947–48) and for Watershed Development, 86th-90th Congresses (1959–68). Special Subcommittees included those: to Investigate Questionable Trade Practices, 80th Congress; to Study Civil Works, 82nd Congress (1951–52); on the Federal-Aid Highway Program, 86th-90th Congresses; and on Economic Development Programs, 89th-90th Congresses (1965–68). Ad Hoc Committees were established on Montana Flood Damage, 88th Congress (1963–64); on Appalachian Regional Development, 88th-90th Congresses; and on the 1967 Alaska Exposition, 89th Congress.
