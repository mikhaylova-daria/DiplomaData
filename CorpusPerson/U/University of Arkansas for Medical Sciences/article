History
In 1879, eight physicians, led by P.O. Hooper of Little Rock, each invested $625 to secure a charter for a medical school from Arkansas Industrial University (which later became the University of Arkansas). They purchased the Sperindio Restaurant and Hotel building on West Second Street in Little Rock for $5,000 to house the school, which opened on Oct. 7, 1879 with 22 students.

In 1880, Dr. Tom Pinson was the first graduate of the medical school. 

In 1935, the medical school was moved to a new building next to the City Hospital in Little Rock. The five-story, $450,000 structure gave the School of Medicine a boost in clinical instruction of medical students. The hospital’s physicians were members of the school’s teaching faculty. The medical school building now houses the University of Arkansas at Little Rock's William H. Bowen School of Law; the hospital building was torn down and became the law school's parking lot.

The next move came in 1950, when a tract of land on West Markham Street was formally deeded to the university by the Arkansas State Hospital, a state-owned psychiatric hospital. In 1956, the university, then known as University of Arkansas Medical Center (UAMC), moved to the West Markham campus where it is currently. The university also assumed control of City Hospital, which moved with it; it became known as University Hospital, and more recently UAMS Medical Center.

The education mission of the institution also has grown. In 1951, the School of Pharmacy was established, followed in 1953 by the School of Nursing. In 1970, the School of Health Related Professions was approved by the University of Arkansas System Board of Trustees. 

In 1995, the UAMS Graduate School was granted independent status from the Graduate School at the University of Arkansas. In 2003, the College of Public Health opened. In 2005, the College of Public Health was named for the late Dr. Fay W. Boozman, a UAMS graduate who led the Arkansas Department of Health from 1998 until his death in 2005.

In 1975, the names of the schools on campus were changed to colleges and the executive officer’s title became chancellor. In 1980, after being known by several different names through history, the institution’s name changed to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).

Dr. I. Dodd Wilson is the current UAMS chancellor. Wilson came to UAMS in 1986 as a professor and dean of the UAMS College of Medicine from the University of Minnesota Medical School, where he was a professor and vice chairman of the Department of Medicine. He was named executive vice chancellor at UAMS in July 1994. He was named chancellor in 2000.

Wilson succeeded Dr. Harry P. Ward, who served 21 years as chancellor and is credited with leading UAMS’ transformation from a small medical school with a charity hospital to an academic health center and research leader. The hospital’s Harry P. Ward Tower is named for him.

Dr. James L. Dennis was the first chancellor. He was originally named vice president of health sciences in 1970, becoming chancellor in 1975 when the title of the institution’s executive officer was changed. To honor his achievements they named the Section of Pediatrics building after him.

Rankings and recognition
UAMS has received various awards and recognition for educational, clinical, and research endeavors over the years. 

In education, UAMS is frequently recognized by U.S. News & World Report as a leader in clinical education, tied for 33rd overall in 2010, and is ranked among the best research medical schools in the nation. U.S. News & World Report also ranks the Geriatrics, Primary Care, and Nursing programs among the best in the nation.

The Antenatal and Neonatal Guidelines, Education and Learning System (ANGELS) program provides real-time telehealth consultation among patients, their local physicians, and medical center specialists through a statewide telemedicine network. The program has reduced the state's 60-day infant mortality rate by 0.5 percent by increasing the number of low birthweight infants delivered at the medical center.

In research, UAMS is well known as a leader in multiple myeloma, geriatrics, vision, and spine treatment research and is home to the Arkansas Biosciences Institute and the UAMS Bioventures Business Incubator. UAMS is ranked in the top 20% of all US Colleges & Universities in research funding from Federal Government, and received $61 million in NIH (National Institutes of Health) funding in 2010. Clinical researchers at UAMS performed the first outpatient bone marrow transplant in the US, as well as the first gene therapy for multiple myeloma in the US. They are also home to a number of robotic, experimental, and advanced treatment facilities found nowhere else in the state of Arkansas. In 2010, UAMS teaching faculty and researcher Jerry Ware, partnered with Harvard Medical School's David Lee, were recognized for their work on a unique platelet treatment to treat rheumatoid arthritis as authoring one of the five most important papers in biology of 2010 by the Faculty of 1000 and were recognized as having produced the top advance in arthritis research by the Arthritis Foundation. Their research is ongoing and has a UAMS/Harvard patent pending through UAMS BioVentures.

The school has the second highest yield of all United States Medical Schools. 

Campus
The UAMS campus, now encompassing more than , is located on Markham Street in Little Rock. The university moved to the property in 1956. The campus includes an estimated of buildings.

Adjacent to the UAMS campus to the south is the John L. McClellan Veterans Administration Hospital, a part of the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System. To the west are the Arkansas State Hospital grounds. Just south of the VA hospital is Interstate 630, a major east-west thoroughfare through Little Rock.

Off campus, UAMS owns or leases several properties, including its seven AHECs, 11 locations across Arkansas of its Kids First pediatric day health clinics, the Westmark building near their main campus, the Westside Campus facility on the Arkansas Children's Hospital campus and a portion of the Freeway Medical building in Little Rock. UAMS also owns over two dozen single family homes and numerous empty lots and parking lots immediately to the east of their main campus. Their master plan calls for the space between Pine street and Cedar street to continue to be purchased when possible as a target zone for future campus growth.

Campus expansion
In 2004, UAMS embarked on the most significant expansion efforts in its history with a slate of projects to provide additional space for its education, patient care, research and outreach programs. The over $500 million expansion effort will encompass several expansion and renovation projects. 

UAMS officials said the expansion effort also was necessary because many programs had outgrown their current facilities. In addition, the predicted increase in the number of persons aged 65 or older that could overburden a health care system that already faces shortages of health care professionals.

The largest project was a , $197 million expansion of the UAMS Medical Center, which includes new patient rooms, operating rooms and space for other programs and services. The hospital expansion is needed to replace the outdated original hospital building, which opened in 1956. The original hospital will undergo renovation in phases to host new academic and research facilities 

The 10-floor new hospital expansion includes 234 adult beds and 60 neonatal beds initially, with space for growth that would bring the total capacity to 393 private adult patient rooms between the new facility and the hospital’s existing Ward Tower. The first 9 floors opened on January 19, 2009, with the 10th floor as shell space for future expansion. As of 2011, high hospital bed occupancy led to construction work on the 10th floor project being started earlier than expected, and is currently underway. The 10th floor build-out will add 60 adult inpatient beds to the hospital. 

The hospital expansion was built at the site of the old student dormitory, which was imploded on Feb. 19, 2006. The dorm was replaced with a , 177-unit Residence Hall, which opened to students in August 2006.

The six-floor, Psychiatric Research Institute facility, a 40-bed facility built adjacent to the hospital expansion, includes space for inpatient and outpatient treatment, education, research and administration. It opened in December 2008. A 1,000-car parking deck was built adjoining and underneath the hospital expansion and PRI.


On Sept. 28, 2007, UAMS honored the late Winthrop P. Rockefeller, former Arkansas lieutenant governor, by renaming its Arkansas Cancer Research Center (ACRC) for him while celebrating the groundbreaking for a major expansion to the facility. The 12-floor, $130 million, addition, located just north of the existing 11 story facility, will allow the institute to treat more patients and host more research into new treatments. The addition opened in July, 2010.

A five-floor, addition to the Jones Eye Institute opened in April 2006. It is named the Pat Walker Tower for the Springdale philanthropist whose gift made the project possible. 

In 2010, construction began on a four-floor, addition to the Donald W. Reynolds Institute on Aging. The $30.4 million addition will be built on top of the existing four-story, building established by a similar grant from the Donald W Reynolds Foundation in 2000. 

An approximately I. Dodd Wilson Education Building was completed in 2008, including 14 25-seat classrooms, two 40-seat classrooms and two 214-seat auditoriums.

UAMS assisted with the construction of a new state hospital in return for the land where the new residence hall is located and most of the old state hospital buildings that transferred to UAMS when construction was completed in 2008. Those buildings have are in various stages of renovation to house programs for the College of Health Related Professions while longer term uses for the land and structures are studied.

A satellite campus in Northwest Arkansas has also opened for the 2009-2010 academic year in the former Washington Regional Medical Center hospital and is in its second year of use. The UAMS Northwest campus is being planned in order to further expand the UAMS student enrollment in medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and allied health and accommodate additional medical residents.
