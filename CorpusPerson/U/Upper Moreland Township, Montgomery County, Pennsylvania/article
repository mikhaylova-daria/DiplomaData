History
William Penn presented the tract of land around present day Upper Moreland Township to Nicholas More in 1682. At the time, the area was referred to as the "Manor of Mooreland". Moreland Township was first used to describe the tract in the 18th century but the current boundaries were not fixed until 1916 when a line was drawn through the Pennypack Creek and two municipalities were created: Upper and Lower Moreland Townships. In 1930, Upper Moreland Township was formally organized as a First Class Township.
