Vegoose was an annual Halloween music and arts festival that took place in 2005, 2006, and 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Unlike the Bonnaroo Music Festival — put on by the same organizers, Superfly Productions and AC Entertainment — Vegoose does not offer on-site camping. In addition to music, the festival features a score of activities, including celebrity impersonators, a wedding chapel, costume contests, a massive pumpkin display, and more.

The festival's current state is in question and did not make a return in 2008. However, the festival may make its return in the near future. A.C. Entertainment and Superfly instead focused their energy on a new festival in San Francisco, the Outside Lands Festival.

Vegoose 2007
The third annual installment of this dynamic entertainment experience took place in Las Vegas over Halloween weekend at Sam Boyd Stadium on Saturday, October 27 and Sunday, October 28. 'Vegoose at Night,' a series of nighttime concerts, presented a variety of artists at marquee venues throughout the city starting on Friday, October 26 and running through Sunday, October 28. The popularity of the event directly affected Vegoose's future. After a decline in attendance in 2006, AC stated in the Las Vegas Review Journal that there had to be an improvement. The official attendance was 40,000 for both days (32,000 in 2006). Executive Producer: Stephen Warner, Directed by: Keith Hobelman.
