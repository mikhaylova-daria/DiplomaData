Victor Matfield (born 11 May 1977) is a South African rugby union player. He has played for and captained the Springbok rugby team as well as the Blue Bulls in the Currie Cup and the Bulls franchise in Super Rugby. He is generally considered one of the best locks in the world and has had a long successful partnership with Springbok and Blue Bulls teammate Bakkies Botha.

Besides almost always winning his own line-out ball, Matfield is known for his exceptional skill at disrupting opposition line-outs – this skill was a cornerstone of their 2007 World Cup success, where he was crowned IRB (International Rugby Board) player of the Rugby World Cup – and his speed around the field led former Australian coach Eddie Jones to comment that he should be an Olympic sprinter instead. He also possesses good upper body strength, with the ability to bench press 155 kg. In 2008 he became the first international captain to beat the All Blacks in New Zealand since Martin Johnson in 2003. Matfield initially retired after the 2011 World Cup after an impressive career, leaving the game as the record Springbok cap holder, but returned after a two-year hiatus by signing a two-year playing contract with the Bulls for 2014 and 2015.

Youth
Born 11 May 1977 in Pietersburg (now in Limpopo Province), South Africa, Matfield grew up with a love for both rugby and cricket, and even represented Far North Schools in the latter. When an injury affected his batting and bowling he decided to pursue rugby instead and was selected for Far Norths junior Craven Week team before playing lock for Pietersburg High School. He made it to the Craven Week competition for high schools in two successive years before being selected for Far North's senior provincial team while still in his final year of high school. 

Junior rugby career
After school, Matfield went to study at the University of Pretoria where he made the university's under-21 side. It did not take long for him to be selected for the Blue Bulls under-21 side as well.

In 1997, Matfield was selected for the under-21 Springbok side captained by Bobby Skinstad. Matfield was also selected for the 1998 squad.

Senior rugby career
A big turning point in Matfield's career came when he decided to leave the Blue Bulls for the Griquas in 1999, where he was also selected to represent the Cats in the Super 12 that year. The move allowed him to prove his worth, and in 2000 he was given the opportunity to represent the Bulls Super 12 team.

His hard work did not go unnoticed, and in 2001 he was finally selected for the Springbok squad, making his debut on 30 June 2001 against Italy. Matfield went on to help the Springboks' renaissance in 2004 and 2005; in the latter year, he made the five-man shortlist for IRB World Player of the Year.

Matfield was an instant selection for South Africa's 2007 World Cup winning-squad, and won the Man of the Match award in the final for his brilliant work in the line-out and, in a show of fine all-round skill, he even put in a perfect cross-field touch-finding kick!

Matfield had been linked with a move to Leicester Tigers of the English Premiership after the 2007 Rugby World Cup., but later signed a six-month contract with French second division club Toulon, beginning in January 2008. At Toulon, he joined an ambitious side whose president Mourad Boudjellai signed many veteran superstars for the 2007–08 season, such as n George Gregan, the sport's all-time leader in international appearances; Andrew Mehrtens, the all-time leading scorer for the All Blacks; and, as coach, former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga.
Between January and February 2008, Matfield played for Toulon in a stretch of nine key, before returning to South Africa and taking part in 2008 Super 14 season with the Bulls. It was reported his decision to return was due to the South African Rugby Union having reconsidered to continue with its policy of allowing a limited number of overseas-based players to play for the Springboks.

Commentator and coach
Matfield retired from the Springboks after the 2011 World Cup, and considered a coaching career in Australia with the NSW Waratahs.

He eventually enrolled domestically as a SuperSport (TV) presenter for the Super Rugby season. He was also part of the coaching team and served as a line-out consultant for the Blue Bulls provincial rugby team in 2013.

In 2014, Matfield returned to rugby as a player, signing a 2-year playing contract with the Bulls to keep him in the game until the end of 2015.

Accolades
Over the course of his career, Matfield has won the Currie Cup final three times (2002, 2004 & 2009), the Super 14 title in 2007, 2009 and 2010, the Tri-Nations in 2004 and 2009 and the Rugby World Cup in 2007.

In 2008 he was inducted into the University of Pretoria Hall of fame.
