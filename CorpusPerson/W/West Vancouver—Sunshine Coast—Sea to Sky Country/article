History
The electoral district was created as "West Vancouver–Sunshine Coast" in 1996 from parts of Capilano—Howe Sound and North Island—Powell River ridings.

In 2003, it was renamed "West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country." At 48 characters, this is the current longest riding name in Canada.

The riding or electoral district is also the first to have been represented in Parliament by a member of the Green Party, Blair Wilson. Elected as part of the Liberal party, he crossed the floor later in his career to become a member of the Green Party representing West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country. However, this came immediately before the 2008 federal election, in which he was defeated, and he never had the opportunity to sit in the House as a Green MP.

Members of Parliament

This riding has elected the following Members of Parliament:
















Current Member of Parliament
West Vancouver-based lawyer John Weston won election in the 2008 federal election for the Conservatives, following a narrow defeat by Liberal Blair Wilson in the 2006 federal election. Weston's legal activities included the establishment of the Canadian Constitution Foundation, founding of Vancouver-based legal firms along with firms in Taiwan, and service with the Department of Constitutional Affairs in Alberta, Quebec, and Newfoundland. During the 40th Parliament, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans and the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.

Former Members of Parliament

The first Member of Parliament to represent the riding was John Reynolds, a former sales and marketing consultant. He was first elected in the 1997 election. He was a member of the Reform Party, and its successors the Canadian Alliance and the Conservative Party. He served as a member on the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Reynolds did not run in the 2006 general election.

Liberal Blair Wilson was elected in the 2006 federal election. Wilson, a chartered accountant and a former restaurant owner, was the first Liberal MP for the historically Conservative riding. He lost to former MP John Reynolds in the 2004 federal election. Wilson resigned from caucus in October 2007 after allegations of improper campaign spending and failure to mention several legal and financial troubles during three nomination vetting processes. He remained a Liberal but not in caucus. In January 2008, Wilson became an Independent. He then joined the Green Party on August 30, 2008, becoming its first MP. Running under the Green banner in the election called only days later, he was defeated by Conservative John Weston.

Future
The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country:
*loses the Powell River Regional District to the new district of Vancouver Island North—Comox—Powell River;
*regains the community of Pemberton and area that had been transferred from it to Chilliwack—Fraser Canyon in the previous redistribution; and
*sees its boundary with North Vancouver adjusted to correspond to the boundaries between the District of North Vancouver, West Vancouver and the Capilano Indian Reserve.
These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which will come into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.
