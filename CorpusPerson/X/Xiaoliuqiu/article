Little Liuqiu, Lamay/Lamey or Golden Lion Island is an island belonging to Taiwan and administered as Liouciou Township of Pingtung County. It has an area of 6.8 km² and lies 15 km (8 nautical miles) west of Donggang; it is Taiwan's only large coral island. The eight villages on the island are populated by approximately 13,000 residents with 10 shared surnames.

Etymology and names
Little Liuqiu was once known as Lamay/Lambay isle, a term that most probably originates from a Taiwanese aboriginal language.

Two years prior to Dutch rule, a Dutch ship named the Golden Lion (Early Modern Dutch: Gouden Leeuw) was wrecked on the coral reefs of the isle. After the Dutch took control of the island, they renamed it "Golden Lion Island" (Gouden Leeuwseylant) as a memorial to the crew who were killed by the native inhabitants.

According to the book of Yuan Shi (book of the history of the Yuan Dynasty), ‘Liuqiu’ originally refers to the island that is today Taiwan. But since the Ming Dynasty the term ‘Liuqiu’ changed to refer to the Lamay island, the island that is today Little Liuqiu. Due to confusion between "Liuqiu" and the Mandarin name of the Ryukyu islands of Japan (which is literally "Liuqiu"), the name "Little Liuqiu" was used since the Japanese Occupation of Taiwan.

After the Republic of China took control of Taiwan, the island was administrated under the name Liuqiu Township as a part of Pingtung County, the only island township of the county.

Geography
Located at the southwest coast of Taiwan, the island is bordered by the Taiwan strait to the west and the South China Sea to the South. It is one of Taiwan's largest coral islands and the only one with significant population and human activities. There are no rivers so farming is very difficult. Most residents make their living by fishing. In recent years the island has become noted for cage aquaculture.

Climate
Liuqiu island has a tropical monsoon climate, with warm temperatures year round with a rainy season from April to October and a dry season with cooler temperatures from November to March of the following year. The sea temperature of Little Liuqiu is above 25 degrees Celsius year round, making it one of the best locations for swimming activities during the winter in Taiwan, as well as allowing up to thousands of species of coral reefs to inhabit the area.

Tourism
Efforts for planned development received a boost after the island was included in the Dapeng Bay National Scenic Area in 2004. Tourism gradually got popular mainly since the late 2000s, with increasing media exposure and advertisements. There are hundreds B&Bs or hotels on the island providing service for the tourists, many of which includes packages such as bicycle renting or scuba diving. According to Pingtung county's statistics of tourism, the number of visitors of Little Liuqiu has peaked above 500,000 per year as of 2013, a relatively large amount for an island that is only 6.8 km² in size.

Some of the best-known local sights include Black Dwarf Cave (烏鬼洞), Beautiful Maiden Cave, Houshih Rock Formations, and Venice Beach.

Liuqiu is a popular tourist destination and is well known for its ghost stories and rumors of haunted caves. The most famous is Black Dwarf Cave. Carved on the entrance of the cave is this story: 


Many have doubted the accuracy of this story and have instead related the "Negroes" to members of the local Siraya tribe, who were massacred in the Lamey Island Massacre.

Beautiful Maiden Cave (美人洞) has a tragic legend attached to its history. The cave is named after the young daughter of a Ming loyalist who was exiled from China by the Manchurians. According to legend, the loyalist lived with his daughter in the cave, surviving on plants and small fish. When the father eventually died, his daughter was so stricken with grief that she bit her own tongue off and died.
