Background
Youngsville today still reflects its history in its people, culture, traditions, and architecture. It was settled in the early 19th century by French Acadian farmers. Prior to 1839, George Roy and his son, Desire, laid out the area and named the community "Royville." The settlement had grown by 1859 large enough to establish one of the oldest Catholic Churches in Lafayette Parish; St. Anne Catholic Church, and had named its oldest street, Church Street. In 1908, the United States Postal Service asked village leaders to change the name because the town was being confused with the north Louisiana town of Rayville. So in 1908, the Village of Youngsville was incorporated. The village was named "Youngsville," meaning young village, and incorporated. It chose a democratic government, an elected Mayor and three Aldermen, to govern its people.
 
The Village continued to develop and on January 20, 1983, Louisiana Governor David C. Treen declared the village a town. The town chose as its governing body, a Mayor and five Aldermen to accommodate its population.

Youngsville has been the fastest growing town in Louisiana from 1990 to 2005. Its population has increased by over 300 percent. According to the 2010 Census, Youngsville grew at a rate of 103% between year 2000 and 2010. Because of its growth, Youngsville was declared a city by then Governor Kathleen Blanco in 2006. From 2000 to 2007, the City of Youngsville was one of the fastest growing municipalities in the State of Louisiana. In 2007, Mayor Wilson Viator and the Youngsville City Council named Joey Langlinais as the Chairman of the Centennial Committee.

Development

Subdivisions
The sugarcane and soybean fields that once completely surrounded the town of Youngsville are becoming more difficult to find. Development began in the 1990s with the original Copperfield subdivision along Highway 89 near Fortune Road. The success of this subdivision led to continuous development throughout the most recent decades. The Copperfield subdivisions (Copperfield, Copperfield South, Copper Ridge, and Copper Meadows) have grown until the subdivisions abutted the original, old town of Youngsville along Iberia Street also known as Highway 92.

Many other subdivisions were also built in the former farmlands of Youngsville, including Field Crest, Oakthorn, and Sugar Mill Pond.

The creators of the River Ranch development in Lafayette have started a new mixed use planned community in Youngsville. Called www.sugarmillpond.com Sugar Mill Pond, it will be home to over 2,000 housing units, a school, and town center with commercial establishments.

Infrastructure
The City of Youngsville began construction of the Chemin Metairie Parkway Project in the spring of 2007 to improve the roads in and around Youngsville. The first segment, from the intersection of Highway 92 and Chemin Metairie, to central Youngsville, opened in early 2009. Originally called the Youngsville Parkway, the road was renamed to avoid confusion with the existing Youngsville Highway also known as Highway 89. When the Parkway is complete, it will join Highway 90 near the Baker Hughes Complex in Broussard. A section of the project passes through the Sugar Mill Pond development and a new shopping complex anchored by Lafayette Parish's first Rouse's Grocery Store.www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070206/BUSINESS/702060318/1046
