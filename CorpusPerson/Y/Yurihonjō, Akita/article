History
The area of present-day Yurihonjō was part of ancient Dewa Province, dominated by the Mogami clan during the Sengoku period. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, part of the area came under the control of Honjō Domain, Kameda Domain and Yashima Domain, with a very small portion under direct rule by the shogunate (tenryō).

After the start of the Meiji period, the area became part of Yuri District, Akita Prefecture in 1878.

The modern city of Yurihonjō was established on March 22, 2005, from the merger of the city of Honjō, and the towns of Chōkai, Higashiyuri, Iwaki, Nishime, Ōuchi, Yashima and Yuri (all from Yuri District). Just after the merger, the new city of Yurihonjō had 126 representatives in its new city assembly, more than the whole of Tokyo.

Economy
The economy of Yurihonjō is based on agriculture and commercial fishing.
