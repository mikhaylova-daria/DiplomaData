Zachary Thomas Moncrief (born January 8, 1971) is a director of animated television programs, currently serving as a director for the Disney Channel cartoon Phineas and Ferb. In 2009, the episode of the series which he directed entitled "The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein" received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for 'Outstanding Special Class Short-format Animated Programs.

Personal information
Moncrief left Montvale, New Jersey, in 1989 after graduating from Pascack Hills High School where his father was the vice principal. Among his classmates were Bruce Beresford-Redman and Rick Hurvitz, the executive producers and co-creators of the MTV reality show Pimp My Ride, as well as CNN White House correspondent Dana Bash. Upon completion of high school, he decided to attend California Institute of the Arts, a Disney-funded college specializing in animation.

Career information
He then gained an internship on an animated feature, The Pagemaster, and moved on as an assistant animator on the film Cats Don't Dance. While there, he sold a pilot to Fred Seibert (then president of MTV Networks and Hanna-Barbera), for the What-A-Cartoon! series titled "Godfrey and Zeek". This transitioned into doing story work for Hanna-Barbera's other series, Johnny Bravo.

Moncrief went on to open his own company, creating animation on several CD-ROMs, as well as a commercial work featuring Warner Bros.' "The Road-Runner", The Carl's Jr. spot featuring Dennis Rodman as well as Animation for a GM sponsored ride at Walt Disney World. Soon after, Mr. Seibert came calling again with a new series on Nickelodeon called Oh Yeah! Cartoons. There, Moncrief created the shorts Kitty the Hapless Cat, Baxter and Bananas, and also worked on other shorts such as The Fairly OddParents and the Emmy winning short "Max and His Special Problem".

Shortly thereafter, he was asked to teach at his alma mater (CalArts) and by Walt Disney Television Animation to storyboard on Teacher's Pet, the series (and its theatrical release) as well as the series "Direct to Videos" for Lilo & Stitch, Kim Possible and the network's latest hit Brandy and Mr. Whiskers.

Next, it was off to help bring back a series that has continued to be one of the strongest animated sitcom's in television history, Family Guy. The show's DVD sales had done so incredibly well that 20th Century Fox Television decided to bring the series back for season 4. Zac started as an Assistant Director and quickly moved into a Director role working on some of Seth MacFarlane's favorite episodes. (See "The Griffin Family History" or "Barely Legal") 

He then followed Dan Povenmire back to Disney again to help Direct over 50+ episodes of the HIT Disney Television series, Phineas and Ferb. His job titles allowed him to be involved in every aspect from breaking stories to writing, from storyboarding to design and color, from editing to calling retakes,. He was even involved in writing a few of the wonderful tunes created for this ground breaking show.

After his long run at Disney, he spent 3 years working at BENTO BOX as the Supervising Director on Comedy Central's hit show Brickleberry while also helping to develop shows at Nickelodeon.

Then, in December of 2013, he joined Warner Bros. Television Animation to Produce and revamp the twelfth series in the Scooby-Doo franchise, titled Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!, which is set to air sometime in the Spring of 2015.
