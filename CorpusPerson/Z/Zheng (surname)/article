Zhèng (Hanyu Pinyin) or Cheng (Wade-Giles) is a Chinese surname and also the name of an ancient state in today's Henan province. It is written as 鄭 in traditional Chinese and 郑 in simplified Chinese.

In 2006, Zheng (Cheng/Chang) ranked 21st in China's list of top 100 most common surnames. Zheng (Cheng/Chang) belongs to the second major group of ten surnames which makes up more than 10% of the Chinese population. Zheng (Cheng/Chang) was a major surname of the rich and powerful during China's Tang dynasty.

In Hong Kong and Taiwan, the name is normally romanized as Cheng or Tcheng, but it is occasionally romanized as Chang in Hong Kong. It is commonly romanized as Cheng, Cheang and Teh in Malaysia, Tay in Singapore and The in Indonesia, from the Hakka, Hokkien and Teochew pronunciation of the character. It also pronounces Dâng in Hokchew.

The surname also has taken form outside of Chinese societies: in Vietnamese as Trịnh. In Korean, the name is written 정 and transliterated as Chung, Jung, or Jeong. It is the fifth most common Korean surname (after Kim, Yi, Park, and Choi), with about 4.85% of the South Korean population (2,230,611 people) having this name.

 Origin 
The Zheng surname originated in Henan. In 806 BC, King Xuan, the penultimate king of the Western Zhou Dynasty, enfeoffed his younger brother Prince You, who became posthumously known as Duke Huan of Zheng, at Zheng (present-day Hua County, Shaanxi). Duke Huan was killed along with King You of Zhou when the Quanrong tribes sacked the Zhou capital Haojing in 771 BC. Duke Huan was succeeded by his son Duke Wu, who helped King Ping of Zhou establish the Eastern Zhou Dynasty in Luoyang, and his feudal state of Zheng was also moved east to present-day Henan. His descendants and many people of the state later adopted Zheng as their surname.
