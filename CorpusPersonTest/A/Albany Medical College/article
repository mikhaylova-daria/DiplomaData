Albany Medical College (AMC) is a medical school located in Albany, New York, United States. It was founded in 1839 by Alden March and James H. Armsby and is one of the oldest medical schools in the nation. The college is part of the Albany Medical Center, which includes the Albany Medical Center Hospital.

Along with Albany College of Pharmacy, Albany Law School, the Dudley Observatory, the Graduate College of Union University, and Union College, it is one of the constituent entities of Union University.

Over its 170 year history, Albany Medical College has attracted and produced many leaders in medicine and research. Among its present and past faculty, researchers, and alumni count two Nobel Prize winners, two Lasker Award winners, two MacArthur Fellowship recipients, one Gairdner Foundation International Award winner, former Surgeon General of the United States Army, former Surgeon General of the United States Air Force, several presidents and CEOs of major academic hospitals, as well as an early president and co-founder of the American Medical Association. AMC is attributed as the site where David S. Sheridan perfected the modern-day disposable catheter, among other major discoveries and innovations. Among AMC alumni accomplishments include the discovery of the hormone leptin, the invention of computed tomography, and the discovery of oral rehydration therapy.

There are multiple courses of study at the College, with tracks that end in an MD degree, as well as a Graduate Studies program with the following departments:
* Center for Physician Assistant Studies, where the students earn an MS in Physician Assistant Studies

In addition to the traditional medical school application process, AMC reserves up to 50 places in its first-year class for participants in combined-degree programs.

Programs range from a total of seven to eight years.

Physician Assistant Studies
The AMC Physician Assistant Program was established in 1972, in collaboration with Hudson Valley Community College. Its graduates received from HVCC the A.A.S. in Physician Assistant Studies, and a certificate of completion from AMC. Since 2005, the program has granted a Master of Science in PA studies. The program's rigorous curriculum consists of a variety of courses in basic and medical science within four didactic terms and an additional twelve months of medical rotations.

Alden March Bioethics Institute

The Alden March Bioethics Institute (AMBI) is a multi-institutional bioethics research organization based at the Albany Medical College in New York. 26 faculty originate first-rate scholarship with the support of more than $3 million in federal and foundation grants.
