Anmore (2006 population 1,785), British Columbia, Canada, is a village municipality in the Greater Vancouver Regional District, north of the city of Port Moody and along the shores of the Indian Arm. It is one of three politically independent villages (municipalities with populations under 2,500) in the Greater Vancouver area, the others being its neighbour Belcarra, and Lions Bay.

A 1978 plan for the village to have 15,000 residents by 1988 was vocally opposed by its residents, and they have instead insisted on preserving what they call their "semi-rural" goal. Consistent with this earlier citizen opposition to development, in a referendum concomitant with the municipal election of 2002, 70% of the citizens of Anmore voted in favour of maintaining the existing RS-1 zoning (1 acre lot size), 70% in favour of the zoning with further enhancements, another 77% voted against half acre zoning, and 67% against a half acre every five years.

Anmore's property values rose by an average of 35% between 2006 and 2007, the largest property value increase in British Columbia.

Anmore is home to the Buntzen Lake recreation area, which has a popular swimming beach. Managed by BC Hydro, the lake is used to power two hydroelectric stations located on Indian Arm.

Origin of the name
Anmore got its name from a local homesteader, F.J. Lancaster, who combined the names of his wife (Annie) and his daughter (Leonore) to make "Annore." This evolved into the village's current name.
