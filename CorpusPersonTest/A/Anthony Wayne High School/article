 Band 

Anthony Wayne High School is most famous for its marching band, the Marching Generals. This high-stepping band has participated in several large-scale events, such as the London New Years parade, Indianapolis 500, Orange Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Kentucky Derby parade, Chicago Miracle Mile Lights parade, and many others.

 Mascot & Colors 

The team mascot is the general and the school colors are royal blue and white.

Prior to the year 2004, the AWHS mascot was a person in an 1812 US Military General's apparel and riding a live horse instead of being a person in a foam costume. The previous mascot appeared only at home football games and would ride across the field just prior to the playing of the National Anthem. Despite continued popularity amongst students (to the point of a decided preference for the "old" mascot), the school adopted the current mascot in order to reduce damage to the football field and allow the mascot to appear at sporting events other than home football games. Many alumni remain disappointed with this decision. The new mascot was the senior gift from the class of 2004.

* Monica McFawn - Flannery O'Connor Award Winner
