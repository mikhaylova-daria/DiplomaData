The Canopus class was a group of six pre-dreadnought battleships of the Royal Navy which were designed by Sir William White for use in the Far East and entered service between 1899 and 1902. The lead ship was , which was followed by , , , and . The class had primary armament consisting of four 12 inch (305 mm) 35 calibre long guns and twelve 6-inch (152 mm) 40 calibre long guns.

The introduction of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 rendered the class, and all other pre-dreadnought battleships, obsolete only a few years after the last-of-class entered service in 1902. The class saw service across the globe: in home waters, on the China Station, in the Mediterranean Fleet, in the Atlantic, in Africa, at Archangel, and in the Mediterranean where HMS Goliath and HMS Ocean were sunk during the Dardanelles campaign. The four surviving ships were reduced to subsidiary duties late in World War I and were scrapped in the early 1920s.

Design

General characteristics
The Canopus-class battleships were designed for use in the Far East to counter the expanding Japanese navy and were required to be able to pass through the Suez Canal. They were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the Majestic-class battleships, although at they were slightly longer.

Armour
The armoured belt, situated at the waterline of the vessel, was thick.

To save weight the Canopus class carried less armour than the Majestics, but a change from Harvey armour in the Majestics to Krupp armour in the Canopus class meant that the protective capability of the armour was maintained. Part of their armour scheme included the use of a special armoured deck over the armour belt to defend against plunging fire by the howitzers that France had reportedly planned to install on its ships, although this report proved to be false.

Armament
Like the Majestics, the Canopus class ships had four guns mounted in twin turrets fore and aft. The final ship, Vengeance, had an improved mounting that allowed loading at any elevation; her turret gunhouses differed from those of her sisters in being Krupp-armoured and flat-sided (Krupp armour plates were difficult to form into curves). The ships mounted twelve guns in armoured casemates as well having some smaller guns and four submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes.

Propulsion
The Canopuses were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power for their weight when compared with the cylindrical boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, consuming of coal per hour at full speed. At they were fast for battleships of their time, a full faster than the Majestics. The Canopuses were able to reach at with a full load of coal.

 made all pre-dreadnought battleships, like those of the Canopus class, obsolete. Before World War I the class saw service in home waters, on the China Station and in the Mediterranean Fleet. After the war began they saw service around the world, including home waters, the Atlantic, Africa, northern Russia and the Mediterranean where two were sunk during the Dardanelles campaign. The careers of the ships were very similar. The four surviving ships were reduced to subsidiary duties late in the war and were scrapped in the early 1920s.

 served in the Home Fleet during 1907 alongside and which served there during 1907–1908 and during 1906–1907. also served there in 1910–1914, along with in 1908–1914. Goliath served there again during 1909–1914, through the renaming of the Home Fleet as the Channel Fleet in 1914.

She began World War I in the Channel Fleet in 1914, then served in the Atlantic and on the South America Station. While on the South America Station she was guard ship at Stanley, Falkland Islands, when Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's German squadron arrived there on 8 December 1914. The German squadron was destroyed in the Battle of the Falklands at the hands of the British battle-cruiser squadron.
