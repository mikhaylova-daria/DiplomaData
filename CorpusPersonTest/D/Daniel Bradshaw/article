Daniel Mark Bradshaw (born 21 November 1978) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Brisbane Bears, Brisbane Lions and the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League.

Bradshaw is best known as a dual premiership forward at the Brisbane Lions.

AFL career

Brisbane Bears era
Bradshaw was drafted by the Brisbane Bears in the 1995 National Draft, from Wodonga, at pick 56 in the fourth round. His athleticism and marking was highlighted by recruiters, with the Bears expecting him to become a key-position prospect. Bradshaw would make his debut in his first season at the club, in round 18 against Richmond at Optus Oval. He played the next two games off the bench, aged 17, at the same ground.

Brisbane Lions years

In only his second year of football, Bradshaw would shine in 1997. He played seniors for the first time in Round 8 at Subiaco against Fremantle, and dominated kicking four goals, and earning the AFL Rising Star nomination, in only his fourth AFL match. A week later he booted six goals against Geelong at the Gabba, his first game at home. He played every game for the season since his addition, being a regular goalkicker. He kicked another bag of seven goals against Hawthorn in Round 18 at the Gabba, as well as four other games of three goals including the Qualifying Final against St Kilda. He would finish equal fourth in the Rising Star, and kick 35 goals for the season in 16 games.
Bradshaw played an inconsistent 1998 season, as the Lions finished last. He would kick only 19 goals in 16 appearances, dropped twice during the season to the QSFL. 1999 was a year to forget for Bradshaw, as he suffered leg stress fractures and would miss the entire season. In what may have been a make or break 2000 season, Bradshaw returned to play a terrific season, despite a rough patch before the mid-season break. He kicked 16 goals in the first four week, including seven against the Western Bulldogs at Colonial Stadium. He would kick 3 goals in his next three matches, all coming against St Kilda, before being subsequently dropped, however he would replace Alistair Lynch as a late change to the Round 8 clash against Essendon, but would not prove anything, having a statless game with nil gametime. After playing in the reserves where he dominated, he came back into the strong line-up, playing the rest of the home and away season. His comeback game saw him kick another career-high seven goals against West Coast. He would kick another two bags of five goals for the remainder of the season, finishing with 56 goals at the end of the home and away season, and sat eighth on the table. His final series attracted attention however, with his qualifying final seeing him contained to one kick, while he pulled out of the Semi-Final against Carlton to be by the side of wife Angie for a premature birth of son Jake. He polled eight votes in the Brownlow Medal.

2001 and 2002
In the 2001 season, which saw the Lions become Premiers, he would kick another 46 goals in 20 games. An important part to the side, he played at both ends if needed, but with Lynch and Jonathan Brown up forward, he was out of favour at times. He still kicked five goals or more in a match on six occasions, including three games in a row mid-season. He played every final, including the 2001 AFL Grand Final. He did continue to struggle in the finals, averaging only three touches in his last four big games. 2002 was another up and down season for Bradshaw where his position as a forward was not secure, and used as a utility more often than not. His accurate kicking and mark however still provided him with 38 goals in 20 games, with eleven goals coming in rounds 2-3. He was dropped just before the finals, but was a late replacement in the Round 21 and 22 games for Craig McRae and Darryl White respectively. He however would re-injure his knee and miss the finals series and a second consecutive Premiership.

2003 and 2004
After an inconsistent season, 2003 was once again similar, but would see Bradshaw miss only two matches, and he would be used at centre half-back more than he previously was. He did however still provide a danger when placed forward, kicking six goals in a match twice, early and late in the season. After struggling in the first two finals, once again, he would finally play a big final when it counted, and played a good role in the 2003 Grand Final against Collingwood, as Brisbane won its third consecutive Premiership, with Bradshaw involved in two. He kicked 28 goals in 24 matches, and signed another three year contract till the end of 2006. 2004 was a very similar season as the previous year, playing as a utility, but proved dangerous in the Final Series, kicking sixteen goals in the last four games, including three goals in the losing side on Grand Final Day. When required to play forward he was unstoppable, four games in the season of five or more goals including another bag of seven goals, this time against Essendon. He kicked 40 goals in 22 games.

2005 and 2006
Bradshaw was more recognised as a key position player after two successful years, and 2005 saw him once again play at both ends, despite winning the goalkicking at the club due to the departure of Lynch. He would kick 42 goals, including a then club record, and career high 9 goals against Melbourne at the Gabba. He would kick five goals on two other occasions, but would still fail to play every game. However, his 2006 campaign was possibly his best season, playing every game for the year, and kicking a career high 59 goals, playing as a permanent forward. He once again dominated Melbourne with an 8 goal performance in Round 14, and would kick 6 goals against Port Adelaide and Essendon.

2007 and 2008
2007 was a year to forget for Bradshaw, rupturing his ACL in March, and missed the entire season, the second time in his career, but his first knee reconstruction. However, his 2008 season has been the best. He appeared in the Hall of Fame Tribute match, playing for Victoria, and kicking a goal. At the break, he has kicked 47 goals in 12 games, placed 4th behind Matthew Pavlich, Brendan Fevola, and Lance Franklin. 2008 was by far Bradshaw's best season finishing 3rd in the coleman medal with 75 goals and a bag of 7 in Round 5 against Hawthorn.

2009
2009 was another fairly good season for Bradshaw kicking 58 goals. He kicked a goal after the siren against Essendon to draw the match at the MCG. and impressed in the Elimination Final against Carlton kicking the sealing goal tight on the boundary line in the pocket. On the 17 October 2009, Bradshaw denied Brisbane's new contract for him and he put himself up for the AFL Pre-season Draft. Sydney selected Bradshaw with their fourth pick in the pre-season draft.

Sydney Swans years

2010

In the 2010 pre-season draft Bradshaw signed with the Sydney Swans after being selected with their fourth pick. He was given the number 19 guernsey, made famous by Michael O'Loughlin. He played his first game in red and white in Round One against St Kilda. It was a thrilling match, where Bradshaw booted a goal, but failed to make a real impact as the Swans went down by eight points. He had his best game for the Swans in Round 6 against his old club the Brisbane Lions on 1 May 2010, kicking six goals, with several spectacular marks, helping the Swans win and end the round on top of the AFL ladder. Bradshaw injured his knee against Geelong down at Skilled Stadium which kept him out for several weeks, but he returned in the finals against the Western Bulldogs. He provided a quality target up forward but let himself down through some poor kicking for goal, though this was probably due to his bad knee.

2011

After missing the first half of the 2011 season, Bradshaw announced that he was retiring from football after losing his battle with injury following another knee operation.

2012 2013

In 2012, Bradshaw played for the Howlong Spiders. He moved to the Dederang Mt Beauty Bombers in 2013. Round one at Dederang on 6 April 2013, Bradshaw kicked 10 goals against Wodonga Saints.
