David Alexander (died 4 February 1995) was a Welsh singer and entertainer.

Early years
Born in Blackwood, Monmouthshire, Alexander left Bedwellty Grammar School at the age of sixteen to support his family. He joined his father and eldest brother in the mines at Oakdale Colliery. In the years after this, he qualified as a machine engineer.

It was at the factory in Cwmbran where he worked that he joined the Trenewydd Singers and enjoyed for the first time the applause of the many people that they entertained for various charities.

Career
Alexander soon began putting together an act for himself. He made his debut at a local social club and left the brake factory where he worked and toured much of the United Kingdom, also working as an entertainer at Pontins.

Whilst at Pontins, he was spotted by manager Byron Godfrey and in 1971 released his first single "If I Could See The Rhondda One More Time" on EMI's Columbia label. It sold thousands of copies and stayed on catlaogue for years (being reissued in 1975). After a less successful single for Columbia the same year ("Dream On Dreamer"), he was released without recording an album. His next single "Taste the Wine" was released on Larry Page's Penny Farthing label in 1974 which was also released across Europe.

He released his first album So Many Ways on his own label in 1975. Initial pressings were on the North West Gramophone label but later pressings and a string of other albums, singles and EPs throughout the late 70's, 80's and early 90's were released on his ACE Recordings label. 

In 1980, Alexander again recorded for EMI with a single "Come Home Rhondda Boy" on Columbia and a self titled album on their budget One-Up label. An updated version of that album was released on ACE (with eleven of the twelve original tracks and three new tracks) as Now and Then.

Alexander had an international presence in song festivals in Czechoslovakia, Malta and Germany, amongst other countries. In 1989, he also toured Australia.

During this time, David found time to support many worthy charities that asked for his help. He ran two marathons and a half marathon in one year to raise several thousand pounds required by a Walton school (Liverpool) for their Sunshine Coach appeal. He continued to raise money for charities such as Cystic Fybrosis research, Alder Hey Children's Hospital and during one show, he managed to raise Â£1,000 to send one of the children to Disney World.

Later years
In 1991, Alexander settled in Tenerife with Penny Page, whom he had met in 1976 and married in 1981. Alexander enjoyed golf and often sang in bars and clubs in and around Tenerife.

Health problems and death
In November 1991, there were fears that Alexander's singing career was over when he was diagnosed with polyps (growths) in his throat. After surgery and a month of intensive therapy, he recovered.

In November 1994, Alexander was rushed into hospital and diagnosed with cardiomegaly (an enlarged heart). He was advised by doctors to limit his workload. On the morning of 4 February 1995, he suffered a heart attack and died, he was 56 years of age. He had made his will a few days earlier on the 23 January 1995.
