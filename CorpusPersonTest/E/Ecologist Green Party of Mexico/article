The Ecological Green Party of Mexico is one of the six political parties to have representation in the Mexican Congress. The party's congressional strength currently stands at 34 deputies (out of 500) and nine senators (out of 128). 

History

 2000 elections 
In the general election of 2000, it allied itself with the National Action Party (PAN) to create the (Alianza por el Cambio) or Alliance for Change.
It was this PAN/PVEM alliance that helped Vicente Fox Quesada win the presidential election. In the senatorial elections of the same date, the party won 5/128 seats in the Senate of Mexico as part of the Alliance for Change.

 2003 elections 
The alliance broke down one year into Fox's administration and, in the July 2003 mid-term elections and various other local elections held since 2000 (in particular, the governatorial races in the important states of México and Nuevo León), the PVEM has allied itself more frequently with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In this alliance it won at the last legislative elections, 17 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

Over the same period the party's support has dwindled amidst accusations of corruption, nepotism, and breaches of Mexican electoral law.
Since securing its registration as a political party on 9 February 1991, it has been run by a single family:
its first president was Jorge González Torres (a public official and former member of the PRI), who was succeeded by his son, Jorge Emilio González Martínez (currently a senator and nicknamed El Niño Verde, or "The Green Boy").
On 3 September 2003 Mexico's top electoral court ruled that its statutes were in violation of the Constitution in that they allowed a restricted inner circle of members to select all the party's candidates and officials.
Shortly after, on 10 October 2003, the Federal Electoral Institute imposed a multi-million dollar fine on the PVEM for campaign finance offenses during the 2000 presidential race.

A further scandal (one of the so-called "videoscandals") engulfed the party in the last week of February 2004 when a video was released in which Jorge Emilio González Martínez was recorded being offered
and, while his reaction is open to interpretation, certainly not vociferously rejectinga bribe in the amount of US$2 million.
According to the video, the funds were being made available by two foulmouthed businessmen in exchange for his assistance in facilitating land use permits for a real estate development near the Caribbean resort of Cancún.
(The municipality of Benito Juárez, in which Cancún is located, is currently governed by a PVEM mayor.)

 2006 elections 
On November 12, 2005, the PVEM formally nominated Bernardo de la Garza as its candidate to the 2006 presidential election, though he resigned on December 5 when the PVEM allied with the PRI. Both parties nominated Roberto Madrazo as their candidate.
In the 2006 legislative elections, the party won 17/500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies & 4/128 in the Senators.


Controversies
Pro-Death penalty campaign

In 2008, the PVEM initiated an advertising campaign in favor of re introducing the death penalty in Mexico. As a consequence, the European Green Party withdrew its recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate Green party.

Anti-LGBT rights stand

During an interview, PVE candidate Gamaliel Ramirez verbally attacked an openly gay candidate for Guadalajara mayor & called for criminal laws against homosexuality to be established. In the following days, Ramirez issued a written apology after the party expressed disappointment at his remarks. 

While the party has pledged to support LGBT rights issues, 3 representatives abstained from a vote on Mexico City granting legal recognition to same-sex couples.

Accusations of corruption and nepotism


As part of the Mexican Videoscandals in 2004, a video showing party leader Jorge Emilio González Martínez accepting a $2 million bribe to give a construction permit in an ecologically protected area aired on national television. González Martínez was taped by one of his own party members, who introduced him to Carlos Ahumada, the businessman interested in the project. The three met in the PVEM headquarters. Later both sides claimed they weren't serious about the bribe, but were testing each other.

The PVEM is also widely criticized because its current leader, Jorge Emilio González Martínez, was appointed for being the son of former leader Jorge González Torres, and for supporting the political and business agenda of Mexican businessman Víctor González Torres, owner of the Farmacias Similares drugstore franchise and González Martínez's uncle.
