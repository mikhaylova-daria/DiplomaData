Facility and services
All inmates are expected to maintain a regular job assignment, unless medically exempted. Many job assignments are controlled through a performance pay system, which provides monetary payment for work. UNICOR has a separate pay scale.
Institutional maintenance jobs are usually the first assignment you will receive. These might include assignments to Food Service, as a unit orderly, or in a maintenance shop. However, a significant number of inmate jobs are available in the Federal Prison Industries. There is a waiting list for factory employment.

UNICOR employs and trains inmates through the operation of, and earnings from, the metal factory which produces high-quality metal products for the Federal government. You must obtain a GED for grade advancement and must participate in the Financial Responsibility Program (if required) to be employed in UNICOR.
Federal Prison Industries, a US government employment program, has a shop at FCI Terminal Island which specializes in repairing, refurbishing, and reconditioning furniture, office equipment, tires, and other government property.
