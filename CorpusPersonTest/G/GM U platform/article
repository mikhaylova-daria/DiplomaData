The U-platform (or U-body) is a front wheel drive minivan and crossover SUV platform from General Motors produced since 1990. North American sales ended in 2009, but Chinese production continues. The minivans were divided into three generations, 1990–1996, 1997–2005 and 2005-current. The U-body was also used for General Motors' first generation crossovers from 2001-2005.

Keeping with its EPA designation as a light truck, the fifth character in the VIN for a U-body is "U", instead of the fourth, as is standard for cars.

Minivans

1st Generation
Released in the fall of 1989 for the 1990 model year, the U platform/GMT199 utilized a galvanized steel space frame underneath composite plastic dent resistant panels similar to those used in Saturn models and the Pontiac Fiero. The vans features unconventional styling, which some commenters likened to a DustBuster vacuum cleaner.

All models used a 120-hp, 3.1L V6 mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission. In 1992, the 3800 Series I V6 became available with a four speed automatic. Both were replaced by the LA1 3400 V6 in 1996.

1990–1996
The vehicles in this generation included:
*Chevrolet Lumina APV ("APV" was dropped from the model name in 1994)
*Oldsmobile Silhouette
*Pontiac Trans Sport

In 1994 The Lumina and Trans Sport received a facelift, which shortened the nose and gave them a more conventional look. The Silhouette however did not receive this update.

International
The Pontiac Trans Sport was sold in Europe as a rebadged Oldsmobile Silhouette with European safety specifications. 

European customers had grown accustomed to sleek minivans, thanks to vehicles such as the Renault Espace, and did not object to the Trans Sport's futuristic styling. In 1994, when the Trans Sport was updated, the European version retained the original shape, with the Oldsmobile Silhouette being sold badged as a Pontiac Trans Sport.

2nd Generation
In 1997 the second U-body (platform) minivans arrived, also known as the GMT200.The new minivans were of unibody steel construction and the styling was intentionally conventional to such an extent that contemporary reviewers remarked that without looking closely at the badging and grille treatments, these minivans could be mistaken for their primary competitors, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, which at the time commanded a 50% share of the minivan market.
Production of this generation was performed at GM's Doraville, Georgia facility, and later at GM Shanghai.

1996–1999 (Europe)
*Opel/Vauxhall Sintra

1997–2005
The vehicles in this generation included:
* Chevrolet Venture
* Oldsmobile Silhouette
* Pontiac Trans Sport
* Pontiac Montana (Montana was a trim level of the Trans Sport prior to 1999)

2000–2005
* Buick GL8 (China only)

International
* The Opel Sintra (badged as the Vauxhall Sintra in the United Kingdom) was an export built in the US alongside other vans for the European market. The Sintra used Opel engines instead of the LA1 3400 V6 engine, that the US vans used.
* The Buick GL8 is sold by Buick only in China.
* The Pontiac Trans Sport of this generation was also sold in Europe, badged as a Chevrolet Trans Sport.



3rd Generation
The U-body was updated once again (GMT-201) in 2005. These vans were referred to as "Crossover Sport Vans" (CSV) by General Motors, in reference to their SUV-inspired styling. North American vans were built in GM's plant in Doraville, Georgia. General Motors ceased minivan sales in the US in 2008. The Pontiac Montana and Chevrolet Uplander continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico for 2009. Production of the Buick GL8 continues in Shanghai, China.

2005–2009
The vehicles in this generation include:
* Buick GL8 (China only, still in production)
* Buick Terraza
* Chevrolet Uplander
* Pontiac Montana SV6 (2005-2006 in the US)
* Saturn Relay

4th Generation

In 2010, Shanghai GM introduced a new version of the Buick GL8 Luxury Business Edition. The previous generation remains on sale as the Business Edition.

Previously a concept car was shown at the 2009 Shanghai Auto Show as the Buick Business Concept

 Crossover SUVs 
In 2001 General Motors decided to produce its first entry into the Crossover SUV category using a shortened U-body platform.

Vehicles:
* 2001–2005 Pontiac Aztek
* 2002–2007 Buick Rendezvous
