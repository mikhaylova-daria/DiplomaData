Gaston Flosse (born June 24, 1931) is a french politician who has been President of French Polynesia on five separate occasions. He is currently a member of the Senate of France and has been a French junior minister under Jacques Chirac. He received sentences for corruption, which are under appeal.

Life and career
Flosse was born in Rikitea, Mangareva, French Polynesia. He is of both French and Polynesian descent.

Flosse supports the current autonomy arrangement between French Polynesia and France and has led the conservative pro-autonomy and anti-independence party Tahoera'a Huiraatira (People's Rally for the Republic Party) for more than 20 years. He was the vice-president of the government council from 1982 to 1984, when more autonomy was gained and he became President of the Governing Council. He held that position from 1984 to 1987 and from 1991 to 2004.

On February 27, 2004, French Polynesian autonomy was again increased, and Flosse became President of French Polynesia (Le président de la Polynésie française). Shortly after, though, his party lost the parliamentary elections, and on June 15, he left office when the parliament, the Assembly of French Polynesia (Assemblée de la Polynésie française), elected the pro-independence leader, Oscar Temaru, to the post.

On October 22, 2004, he was re-elected to the presidency, and he took office that day, although doubt was cast on the legitimacy of this election by Antony Géros, the President of the French Polynesia Assembly (see French Polynesia political crisis 2004). On February 13, 2005, Flosse's party lost the parliamentary by-elections, which had been called as a compromise after pressure from Temaru's supporters. On February 18, 2005, Flosse lost the presidency again in a parliamentary confidence vote, and on March 3, 2005, Temaru took over.

Apart from having been president of the territory, he has also been both tourism minister and housing minister. He is the mayor of Pirea municipality north of Papeete and has represented the territory in the National Assembly of France. He was first elected to the Senate of France on October 1, 1998.

Flosse was able to govern French Polynesia with the support of centrist parties and groupings. He and French President Jacques Chirac have a close personal association, Chirac being a godfather to Flosse's youngest son. This relationship, of course has given the Tahitian special access to the highest levels of power in France, which he has utilised in negotiating aid packages and financial support for the territory.

On 21 June 2006 Flosse was convicted of corruption and given a three-month suspended sentence. The court found that he had abused his political office in connection with a hotel purchase. He continued to be a member of the territorial assembly and French Senate.

Flosse's party came third in the February 2008 legislative assembly elections, but with the support of Oscar Temaru and his UPLD (Union for Democracy) party, which came second, Flosse became President of French Polynesia again on 23 February 2008. He was replaced by Gaston Tong Sang after losing a vote of confidence on 15 April 2008, however.

Flosse was re-elected to the French Senate in the September 2008 Senate election.
