George Edward Cole, OBE (born 22 April 1925) is an English film and television actor whose career has spanned more than 70 years in show business. He played Arthur Daley in the long-running ITV drama show Minder, and Flash Harry in the early St Trinian's films.

Biography
Cole was given up for adoption at the age of ten days and adopted by the Cole family. He left school to be a butcher's boy but landed a part in a touring musical, and chose acting as a career. He appeared in a film with British stage and film actor Alastair Sim, and Sim and his family took in Cole and his adoptive mother when he was 15. They helped him lose his Cockney accent and he stayed with the Sims until he was 27.

Cole began appearing in films in the early 1940s, debuting in the 1941 film Cottage to Let. He attributes the success of his career to Alastair Sim, who became his mentor. Cole appeared in a total of 11 films with Sim, starting with Cottage to Let, and ending with the somewhat obscure 1961 independent film The Anatomist.

He also acted opposite Laurence Olivier in The Demi-Paradise (1943) and Olivier's film version of Henry V (1944). He is the last surviving member of the large cast of Henry V. His career was interrupted by his service in the Royal Air Force from 1944 to 1947.

He was well known for his lead role in the 1953-1969 radio comedy A Life of Bliss where from the eighth episode (David Tomlinson played Bliss in the first seven episodes), he played an amiable but bumbling bachelor, David Alexander Bliss, with his dog Psyche, voiced by Percy Edwards. It lasted for six series and just six of the 118 episodes made of the radio series now survive. This became a TV series in 1960.

He became familiar to audiences in British comedy films in the 1950s. Cole appeared with Sim in Scrooge (as the young Scrooge) in 1951, but his best known film role was as "Flash Harry" in the St Trinian's films (two of which also star Sim), and in the comedy Too Many Crooks (1959). He also starred in the 1973 film Take Me High alongside Cliff Richard and Deborah Watling.

His most memorable television role was as crooked used-car dealer Arthur Daley in the Thames Television series Minder which he played from 1979 to the show's conclusion in 1994.

George has recently been cast in a new crime-horror film called Road Rage, in the role of Cyril, which will be released in cinemas in 2015.

Autobiography 
Cole released his autobiography, The World Was My Lobster, in 2013.

Television roles
Doctor Syn, The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh, was produced as a three-part television film in color by Walt Disney in 1963, a miniseries before the term was ever coined. It was shot on location in England and was directed by James Neilson. It starred Patrick McGoohan of Danger Man/Secret Agent and The Prisoner fame in the title role, with George Cole as Mipps. A Man Of Our Time (1968) (TV series - Rediffusion London) Minder (1979 on) (TV series - Thames/Euston Films).

Cole appeared as a guest star in the Gerry Anderson produced UFO series. In the episode Flightpath, Cole plays Paul Roper, a blackmailed SHADO operative, who opens the door for a possible alien attack on Moonbase. Roper redeems himself by destroying the aliens but ultimately sacrifices himself in the process. He also made a guest appearance as Tom Good's bank manager in a special edition of the BBC sitcom The Good Life in the mid-1970s, filmed in front of Her Majesty The Queen.
