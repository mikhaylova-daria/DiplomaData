The Greatest Hits Collection is a compilation album released by Bananarama which features their single releases and greatest hits. It was issued by London Records in 1988, shortly after the departure of group member Siobhan Fahey. The track listing differed between the version of the album in the United States and the version released throughout Europe.

All songs are represented here in their "single" edits (or in some cases, a remix) and the version of "I Want You Back" (originally on their Wow! album) on this collection is the newer version of the song with the vocals re-recorded by Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward with new member Jacquie O'Sullivan, following the departure of Fahey. One new song, "Love, Truth and Honesty", was released as a single (which featured O'Sullivan's first credits as a song-writing contributor), and peaked inside the UK top 30. The other new track on the compilation was a re-recorded version of the Supremes track "Nathan Jones." Like "I Want You Back", this song was originally included on the Wow! album released before Fahey's departure. The new line-up re-recorded the song with new vocal and instrumental arrangements. This new version was included both on this compilation as well as the Rain Man soundtrack. It was subsequently remixed and released as a single, reaching the UK Top 20.

Subsequent re-issues have added on dance remixes, as well as a cover of the Beatles hit, "Help!"
