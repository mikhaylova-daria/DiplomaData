Landmarks

Giant Cross
There is a 19-story cross located next to Interstate 40 (formerly U.S. Route 66) at Groom. This tall free-standing cross can be seen from twenty miles (32 km) away. Surrounding the base of the cross are life-sized statues of the fourteen Stations of the Cross. Inspired by this cross, residents of Effingham, Illinois erected a similar cross that is eight feet taller. Many claim this cross to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere. However, it is smaller than the cross erected in the Valle de los Caidos in Spain, located at and elevated 152.4 m overground. The cross is also shorter than the cross at the Mission Nombre De Dios in St. Augustine, Florida, and shorter than the tall Lakeuden Risti cross-shaped church tower in Seinäjoki, Finland. The movie Leap of Faith was filmed on location near the site of the cross in Groom but the movie was filmed before the cross was built.

Leaning Water Tower
Also in Groom one can find a leaning water tower which currently serves as a decorative item. It originally was a functioning water tower which was slated for demolition until Ralph Britten bought it and moved it to serve as a sign for his truck stop and tourist information center (located on a stretch of interstate that was once a part of U.S. Route 66). This truck stop can still be seen, set back off the road behind the tower, now boarded up and in disrepair following a devastating fire decades ago.

The leaning water tower still remains a popular target for cameras, and the town of Groom turns on a large colored star mounted on the top around Christmas time. The water tower is a common image from Route 66 photography books.

Education
The Town of Groom is served by the Groom Independent School District and is home to the Groom High School Tigers.

History

Early Exploration
The route from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Santa Fe, New Mexico along the Canadian River was charted circa 1849 by Captain Randolph Barnes Marcy. Published in 1859, Marcy’s book, The Prairie Traveler: A Handbook for Overland Expeditions, contained maps and illustrations of routes between the Mississippi and the Pacific and was used as a basic manual by westward-bound wagon trains and travelers for years.

Colonel B. B. Groom
Colonel B. B. Groom, an experienced cattleman near Lexington, Kentucky, leased from the New York and Texas Land Company of land in Hutchinson, Carson, Gray, and Roberts counties in the Texas Panhandle in 1882, resulting in the organization of the Francklyn Land and Cattle Company. Groom purchased an estimated 1,300 head of shorthorns in 1882 and selected the Diamond F brand, approved by the Francklyn officials and filed as the company's brand in October 1882. Unfortunately, Groom's vision of the finest and most desirable cattle ranch in the United States did not materialize for him. The Francklyn Land and Cattle Company became insolvent in 1886. The bondholders foreclosed and organized a new company known as White Deer Lands (later White Deer Land Company), under the management of the agent Timothy Dwight Hobart, one of the subsequent founders of Pampa, Texas.

Harrison Groom
Colonel Groom’s son, Harrison Groom established a camp at the edge of a little lake just west of the present town of White Deer.

The Town
The site of Groom, Texas, was chosen in 1902, along the route of the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway. Groom was first incorporated in 1911.
