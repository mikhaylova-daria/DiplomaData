It wasn't until the 1995 series Ohranger that Gorenger and J.A.K.Q. were included as the first two series.

Storyline
When world peace is threatened by the emergence of a terrorist group called the Black Cross Army, a secret espionage organization known as EAGLE is formed in Japan to combat the threat. The Black Cross Army, fearful of the threat against them, decides to launch a surprise attack against EAGLE.

Across Japan, the Black Cross Army sends its five most dangerous operatives to destroy each EAGLE branch, killing everyone except for five young agents who miraculously survive. The agents are summoned to the snack shop "Gon" by Gonpachi Edogawa, EAGLE's commander, and enter a secret command center hidden underneath. The five are recruited by Edogawa to become the Secret Squadron Gorenger, the world's best chance against the forces of the Black Cross Army. They are given electronic battlesuits that endow them with superhuman strength and speed. The five dedicate themselves to stopping the Black Cross Army and its sinister leader, Black Cross Führer.

Finishing attacks

*: In this variant, Momorenger would produce a finned, multicolored grenade the size and shape of an American-style football. It was passed among each Gorenger until Aorenger set it up for punting by Akarenger. Once launched towards the monster, it would transform into an object that was usually either anathema to the monster's personality (such as a magnet to disrupt a mechanical clock monster) or a gift (such as a bowl of ramen to a skeleton-themed, starving monster). Either way, the object explodes with the monster caught in the explosion. In episode 73, the ball transforms into the Gorengers' weapons (Red Hunter, Yari Vute, Blue Arrows, Ki Sticker, Momo Card and Mido Puncher). In episode 44, it is called Gorenger Storm Hurricane.
