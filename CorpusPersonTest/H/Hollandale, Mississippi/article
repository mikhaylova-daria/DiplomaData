History
Hollandale was named for Dr. Holland, the original owner of the town site.
 
Hollandale was incorporated in 1890, and almost completely destroyed by fire in 1904.

A one-room school house in Hollandale was founded by Emory Peter "E.P." Simmons in 1891. One of the first schools for African-American children in the area, it was used until 1923, when financial support from the Rosenwald Fund enabled the construction of a larger brick school. Simmons worked as an educator and administrator for 52 years, and Simmons High School in Hollandale is named in his honor.

Thomas Roosevelt "T.R." Sanders was a noted community leader. Sanders was principal of Simmons High School for 33 years, and the first superintendent of the Hollandale Colored School District. Sanders developed 'Sanders Estates', the town's first subdivision, and organized an association which provided running water to neighboring Sharkey County. Sanders was the first African-American in Mississippi to receive a master's degree in educational administration.
