History
I.R.A. was formed in 1986 Fall, under the name S.I.D.A.

They started rehearsing in the house of a friend, but were soon thrown out because of the noise and disorder of the public that attended; they then began to rent one of the first rehearsing places that existed in Medellín, where the quality of the sound was bad. Still, it was one of the few options that the band had in order to continue.

In 1986 they changed the name of the band to I.R.A. ("Ideas de Revolución Adolescente") ("Ideas of Adolescent Revolution").
