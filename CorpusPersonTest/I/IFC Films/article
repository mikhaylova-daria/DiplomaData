Video on Demand (VOD) and DVD
IFC has several ventures in video on demand (VOD), available through cable television pay-per-view, Apple iTunes, and Blockbuster's Movielink. 

IFC First Take
IFC First Take, launched in 2006, combines a limited theatrical release with availability the same day by VOD. The films show in IFC's New York theater IFC Center, as well as other theaters that may participate. Landmark Theatres were the first outside theaters announced.

Day-and-date vs. release windowing
Traditionally, in the United States, theatrical movies are released with windows separating the theatrical run, then airline and paid hotel showings, then DVD release, then pay-per-view cable, then premium cable, also called pay TV (HBO, etc.), then broadcast and basic cable. VOD services, starting with the first legal one, Movielink, generally gained the rights to the same window as pay-per-view. This put them after the DVD release. Making VOD release simultaneous with DVD is called day-and-date, or collapsing the window.

IFC First Take goes further, with day-and-date meaning simultaneous theatrical release and VOD, though DVD may come months later. For instance, I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With came out on First Take in September 2007. The full retail DVD release occurred on April 15, 2008, though Blockbuster's "exclusive" rental was made available in March 2008.

In a March 2008 panel discussion, IFC Film's Arianna Bocco stated that all its films would be released through First Take.

Initial releases
Films initially distributed by IFC First Take included:
* C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America (2004) – a mockumentary by Kevin Willmott
* American Gun (2005) – by Aric Avelino
* I Am a Sex Addict (2005) – by Caveh Zahedi
* Russian Dolls (2005) – by Cédric Klapisch
* Sorry, Haters (2005) – by Jeff Stanzler
* Three Times (2005) – by Hou Hsiao-Hsien

IFC Festival Direct
IFC Festival Direct, announced in 2008, is VOD distribution for films not slated for theatrical release in the United States. Non-theatrical films are known as straight-to-video, but the idea of Festival Direct and other new models is to remove the stigma of that term.

Initial releases
The first films scheduled for IFC Festival Direct were:
* Jar City (2006) – by Baltasar Kormákur, an adaption of a novel by Arnaldur Indriðason
* It's a Free World... (2007) – by Ken Loach
* Beautiful Ohio (2006) – by Chad Lowe
* Puffball (2007) – by Nicolas Roeg 
* Good Time Max (2007) – by James Franco

Apple iTunes
In 2006 IFC Films began distributing some films to Apple iTunes. The first batch were thirteen films with nominations in the Independent Spirit Awards.
