"If I Ain't Got You" is a song recorded, written, and produced by American recording artist Alicia Keys for her second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys. Released in February 2004 as the album's second single, the song peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Keys' second consecutive R&B chart-topper, remaining atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The song received two nominations at the 2005 Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, winning in the latter.

A remix featuring Usher, a Kanye West Radio Mix, and a Spanish-language version featuring Arturo Sandoval appear on the bonus CD of select international pressings of The Diary of Alicia Keys. The song is featured in the 2004 PlayStation 2 karaoke game Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.

The single cover depicts Keys similarly to the subject of Man Ray's 1924 painting Le Violon d'Ingres.

Keys said that the idea of the song was inspired by Aaliyah's death: "The song idea came together right after Aaliyah passed away. It was such a sad time and no one wanted to believe it. It just made everything crystal clear to me—what matters, and what doesn't."

Commercial performance
"If I Ain't Got You" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number sixty-four on the issue dated March 6, 2004, peaking at number four, four months later, on July 3, 2004.

It was also successful on Billboard component charts, reaching number five on the Rhythmic Top 40 and number nine on the Mainstream Top 40.
