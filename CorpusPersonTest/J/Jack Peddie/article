John Hope "Jack" Peddie, also called Jock Peddie, (3 March 1876 – 20 October 1928) was a Scottish football player who played for various clubs in both England and Scotland, including Newcastle United, Manchester United, Plymouth Argyle and Hearts. As a Plymouth Argyle player, he is most famous for scoring their first ever goals in the Western and Southern Leagues.

Born in Southside, Glasgow, Peddie began his football career with Scottish club Benburb, before moving to Third Lanark in June 1895. Two years later, he moved across the border into England and turned professional with Newcastle United in November 1897. Peddie helped his new club gain promotion to the top flight in his first season in 1898 as well as netting a brace in an impressive 2–1 FA cup upset of top flight Preston North End the same season. Peddie scored Newcastle's two goals in their first ever game in the English First Division in a 4–2 home defeat at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Newcastle's first win in the division came at home to Liverpool in November 1898 when Peddie scored two goals in a 3–0 result. In total he scored 78 goals in 135 appearances and was Newcastle's top scorer for four consecutive seasons from the 1897-1898 season to the 1900-1901 season.

After five seasons at centre forward, Peddie moved to Manchester United in June 1902. He departed in 1903 for Plymouth Argyle ahead of their first season as a professional club. He scored their first competitive goals in both the Southern League and Western League, and scored 21 goals from 46 appearances in his one year at Home Park. He returned to Manchester United in 1904. In 1906, Peddie made an important contribution of 20 league and cup goals as Manchester United won promotion back to the First Division. In total, he scored 58 goals for Manchester United and became their club captain during the 1904-1905 season.

In January 1907, he moved back to Scotland to play for Hearts alongside Richard Wombwell and William Yates for a joint fee of £600. In the first round of the Scottish Cup, Hearts defeated Airdrieonians 2–0 at Broomfield and Peddie scored the second goal. Peddie missed the semi-final victory over Queens Park due to a knee injury which eventually ended his career. At Tynecastle, Peddie received £5 per week in wages and he played inside right and centre forward.

In May 1907, Peddie received considerable treatment for the knee injury and was back in the team at the start of the 1907–08 season. But the injury kept flaring up and he played only 23 first team matches during 1906–07 and 1907–08 seasons, scoring five goals. When James McGhee replaced William Waugh as Hearts manager in April 1908, Peddie was transfer listed at £100. As Hearts retained Peddie's contract until April 1911, he played amateur football from August 1908. He later emigrated to the United States and settled in Detroit, until his death in 1928 at the age of 52.
