Johnny Hates Jazz is a British pop rock band, presently consisting of Clark Datchler (songwriter, vocalist, keyboard player) and Mike Nocito (producer, engineer). In April 1987, they had international success with their first hit single "Shattered Dreams".

Early career
Both Datchler and Nocito were born into musical families. Datchler's father, Fred, was a member of two chart-topping bands from the 1950s. The Stargazers had the distinction of being the first British band to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. As part of the Polkadots, Fred Datchler sang backing vocals for The Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Petula Clark. Nocito hails from an American family, based in Europe with the United States armed forces. His mother was a singer in a close-harmony group called The Cactus Kids, performing for troops throughout Northern Europe.

Having been a singer, guitarist and keyboard player in numerous bands as a teenager, Datchler released his first single on the London independent record label, Bluebird Records at the age of 17, backed by members of reggae band Aswad. He went on to work with Rusty Egan of Visage, fusing electronic music with soul, and performed often on the London club scene. He was subsequently signed to Warner Brothers Music as a songwriter and moved to Los Angeles, California, United States.

Nocito was a guitarist in school bands, having grown up alongside friend and fellow record producer, Phil Thornalley, as well as members of Katrina And The Waves. He became a recording engineer and worked with Pink Floyd, The Police, The Cure, Duran Duran and the Thompson Twins.

They two met in 1982 at RAK Studios in London. Datchler had just become lead singer in the band, Hot Club, alongside another original JHJ member, Calvin Hayes. The line-up also included bass player Glenn Matlock and guitarist James Stevenson. In 1983, Hot Club released a single on RAK Records and performed at London's Marquee Club, a performance that impressed RAK head, Mickie Most. He decided to sign Datchler to the label as a solo artist. It was Most who suggested that Datchler work with Nocito, who was an engineer at RAK Studios at the time. Over the next four years, the two worked together on Datchler's solo recordings. Most also guided Datchler, producing several of his recordings in the mid-1980s.

Original line-up
In April 1986, Datchler, Nocito and Hayes released the first Johnny Hates Jazz single, "Me And My Foolish Heart", on RAK Records. It was not a commercial success, but gained substantial airplay and was Sounds magazine's record of the week.

Datchler began writing new songs which included "Shattered Dreams". JHJ then performed a showcase at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, and were subsequently signed to Virgin Records. "Shattered Dreams" was released in March 1987 and became a top 5 hit in the UK, throughout mainland Europe and Asia, and reached No. 2 in Japan. It was followed by three other worldwide hits, "I Don't Want To Be A Hero", "Turn Back The Clock" (featuring Kim Wilde on backing vocals) and "Heart Of Gold". In 1988, "Shattered Dreams" reached No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, No. 1 on the US Adult Contemporary chart, and climbed to No. 4 in Canada. That same year, their album, Turn Back The Clock, entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1, selling four million copies.

At the end of 1987, JHJ made two music videos with director David Fincher. The videos were for the US releases of "Shattered Dreams" and "Heart Of Gold". Datchler left the band at the end of 1988.

Post break-up
Datchler moved to Amsterdam at the end of the 1980s and focused on his solo work, recording the albums Raindance and Fishing For Souls. Returning to the UK, he based himself at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios near Bath throughout the 1990s. In 2000, he moved to the US and created a solar-powered home and studio, where he recorded much of his most recent album, Tomorrow. Throughout this time, he studied the philosophy of indigenous people, became environmentally active and, in 2008, he received a GreenTec Award (formerly the Clean Tech Media Awards) in Berlin.

Nocito went on to make another album under the JHJ banner with Hayes and Thornalley entitled Tall Stories. He then based himself in Cambridge, England and produced the Katrina and The Waves' single "Love Shine A Light", winner of the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest and a top 10 hit throughout Europe. He also produced and wrote for Hepburn, Gina G, and Orson, and continued to work extensively with Katrina and The Waves.

New era
Datchler and Nocito met again in 2009 after Datchler wrote a song called "Magnetized", which he felt would be ideal for Johnny Hates Jazz. Soon after, they decided to record a new album. Datchler moved back to the UK and wrote the rest of the songs for the project. At the same time, the original JHJ line-up of Datchler, Nocito and Hayes performed live at various international festivals. However, after several shows in 2010, Hayes left the band before recording of the new album had commenced.

That same year, Datchler received a BMI award for "Shattered Dreams", receiving over three million broadcast performances in the US alone.

The subsequent album was entitled Magnetized. Recording spanned much of 2011 and 2012, and took place at Real World Studios near Bath, Hamp Sound near Cambridge, and Angel Studios in London. It featured Datchler as songwriter / vocalist / keyboard player, and Nocito as producer / engineer. There are also string arrangements and additional keyboards from Anne Dudley, who had arranged the strings on "Turn Back The Clock". Other contributors include drummer Alex Reeves, guitarist David Rhodes, synthesizer player Pete Watson, and mix engineer Stephen W. Tayler.

The first single, "Magnetized", was released in the UK on 28 April 2013, and received widespread airplay, reaching No. 1 on the BBC Radio 2 airplay chart. The album release dates were 5 May in the UK, and 26 May 2013 in the rest of the world. A tour and further single releases are being planned.
