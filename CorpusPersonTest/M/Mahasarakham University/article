History
The historical development of Mahasarakham University can be traced back to March 27, 1968, when it was established as Mahasarakham College of Education for strengthening and expanding higher education in the Northeastern region (Isan) of the nation. Located in the outer north area of Maha Sarakham Province, a small town right at the center of the region, the college has been responsible for developing quality educators to serve educational institutions of all levels. In 1974, the college's status was elevated when it became a regional campus of Srinakharinwirot University. At that time, there were four academic faculties: Education, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Science.

In 1994, the college gained its statutory status through the Thai Higher Education Act and became Mahasarakham University, the 22nd public university of Thailand

Mahasarakham University has since expanded rapidly in academic infrastructure and facilities, and relevant services, and become a comprehensive university, offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs in three academic clusters: Social Sciences; Pure and Applied Sciences; and Health Sciences. In 1988, Khamriang Campus, known as the New Campus. was set up in Kantarawichai District, approximately seven kilometers from the Old Campus.

With 17 faculties and 2 colleges, the University has been recognized as one of Thailand's fast-growing universities. The total student enrollment has increased from thousands in its earlier years to about 45,000 students in 2010. Many faculty buildings have been constructed on the Khamriang Campus; is now the University's Administrative and Academic Center.

In addition, to extend its academic services to remote communities, the University has had 15 Academic Service Centers in the Northeastern region, and later reorganized into two main centers located in Nakhon Ratchasima Province and Udon Thani Province.
