NBA Street Vol. 2 is the sequel to NBA Street. It was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and for the first time in the series, on the Xbox. Japan was only able to see a PlayStation 2 release of this game. The GameCube version was also planned to be released in that region, but it was canceled for unknown reasons.

Summary
In the game, there are 29 fully playable NBA teams in all modes once unlocked. The game also features four different modes to choose from including a Pick-Up Game (Regular game, default is 21 points, and can be set to 50 points), NBA Challenge (Beat all NBA teams and the legends from there with a normal or customizable team), Street School (Learn the basic and advanced moves and tricks in NBA Street Vol. 2), and Be a Legend (Create your own baller and become a legend). The game also features several new trick moves and dunks as well as introducing a level two "gamebreaker".

The game, at the time of release, was the only available game on the market in which three incarnations of Michael Jordan are playable: the 1985 Chicago Bulls Jordan, the 1996 Chicago Bulls Jordan, and the Washington Wizards Jordan. It is possible to play as a team made up of the three different Jordans (or the "All-Jordan" team as Bobbito García refers to it). This game features Michael Jordan, Julius Erving, and "Bonafide" on the front game cover.

Game Selections
Pick Up Game is one of the three places where you can play a game. In the mode, you are able to play against the computer, or a user wanting to play the game.

NBA Challenge is another option of gameplay, but in this mode you have to play at a certain court and try to win against the assigned teams in the regional courts they are in. In NBA Challenge, you are able to unlock NBA Legends as well as courts, and reward points.

Be A Legend is the last gameplay option. In this mode, you have to create a player and try to succeed by becoming the Street Legend Champ. In order to do that, you have to gain a reputation by creating a team and playing pick up games that are assigned on the map. The higher the reputation you go, the more competition you get. Also in this mode, you get to unlock the street legend characters, courts, jersey, and your own created player.

Street School is where you learn how to play the game. The instructor is street legend, "Stretch" and he teaches you the basics as well as the complex parts of the game.

Street Legends Summaries
*Clifford 'Stretch' Monroe (Hometown: Harlem, NY) is an afro-adorned player. He was known as the, "best not to make to the NBA." Stretch's dunking stats are maxed out (indicated by a gold crown) and has a signature dunk called "Stretch" that you can use in the game with a specific combo. He is one of the better dunkers in the game, and his height leads him to play closer to the hoop instead of shooting from the paint. Stretch is also the teacher of "Street School."

*Biggie Little (Hometown: Chicago, IL) is one of the better ball-handlers in the game, with his handling stats maxed out and a signature trick move called "Biggie Littles", where he does a hand-stand on the ball. He is one of the new additions to the game. He is visibly very young compared to the rest of the game's characters. His crossovers seem to be challenging to stop in the game, and (without that fact that he can't dunk) is an overall good player, but is very short (5' 4").

*Whitewater (Hometown: Seattle, WA) is a very tall player, which makes him a decent center and blocker, and his shooting stats are maxed out, with a signature shot called "Whitewater". Since he is tall, he also makes a decent dunker. He was supposed to be a replacement for Drake, who is in NBA Street. He is known as the fundamental basketball player, but he still has some street in him.

*Dime (Hometown: Los Angeles, CA) is the only female street legend in the game (unless you create your own). She is a great defensive player, and has her steal stats maxed out, and decent handles with her signature move called, "Droppin' Dimes". Throughout all the streets, she's the only "official" woman street legend in the game.

*Osmosis (Hometown: Oakland, CA) is a well-rounded offensive and defensive player, with his stats maxed out on blocks, and pretty decent handling stats with a signature handle move called "Osmosis", where he dribbles the ball with his feet. He was taught by Jason Kidd (not in real life). He is last year's (2002) Street Champion. He plays at Mosswood Park, a real streetball court in Oakland.

*Bonafide (Hometown: Philadelphia, PA) is a great rebounder (with his rebound stats maxed out) and is an over-all well-rounded player. The young blood has returned to the streets and now rules Rucker Park. He took Stretch's home court away as he beat him in the tournament. He's also a great dunker as he has a signature dunk called "Bonafide".

* Bobbito Garcia aka "DJ Cucumber Slice" (Hometown: New York, NY) is the announcer of the game and is featured in the game as a player. In real life, Bobbitto is actually a basketball announcer and he is a streetball legend! He is an excellent shooter and has excellent handles. He's one of the bonus players in the game, so you have to unlock him in order to use him.
