She is also seen jogging on a treadmill with a changing foreground in front, she is also seen lying in shallow water and on a bed in the dark with orange laser moving down her. Lisa Lopes comes into the video to do her rap and both of them are seen doing Tai-chi. Later Melanie is floating up in a high-ceiling room and ends with Melanie looking at the outside view.
