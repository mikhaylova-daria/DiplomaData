The combined company has combined annual sales of approximately $11.2 billion, employs about 66,000 associates, and serves consumers and businesses in 59 countries with more than 2,200 retail stores, e-commerce sites and a business-to-business sales organization.

 History 
Staples and Office Depot was founded in March 1986 by the late F. Patrick Sher, the former chairman and chief executive officer; Stephen Dougherty, the president; and Jack Kopkin, the executive vice president. All three were formerly associated with Home-owner's Warehouse, the home improvement company that Sher sold to Service Merchandise in 1983 and renamed as Mr. HOW Warehouse. The catalog showroom chain eventually sold off the Mr. HOW Warehouse units to a variety of buyers including Builders Square, the home center warehouse subsidiary of Kmart Corporation. They envisioned a warehouse-style store for office products where customers could purchase items in bulk for discounted prices. This concept led to the beginning of what is known as Office Depot, and the company opened its first store at Lakes Mall in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida in October 1986.
