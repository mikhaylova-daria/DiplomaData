Quiet Life is the third album by the British band Japan, released firstly in Japan, Germany, Canada and other countries in December 1979, then in the UK in January 1980 (due to a delay in manufacturing the album).

History
Musically, the album was a significant departure for the band as their previous two albums had been more in the vein of alternative glam-punk (much-influenced by The New York Dolls), as opposed to the new wave leanings exhibited on this album. Quiet Life is often erroneously listed as one of the first albums of the New Romantic movement, though Japan always flatly denied they were New Romantics.

Recorded in 1979, Quiet Life was the last of three albums the band made for the Hansa-Ariola label (they switched to Virgin Records in 1980), though Hansa would later issue a compilation album (Assemblage) that consisted of non-album singles and album highlights from the band's tenure on the label. The album is also notable for being the first album where singer David Sylvian used his newfound baritone vocal style, which became one of the band's most distinctive hallmarks.

Reception
Though initially unsuccessful upon its release in the band's native UK (where it peaked at #72 in February 1980), the album returned to the charts in early 1982 after the commercial success of 1981's Tin Drum and the Hansa Records compilation Assemblage. It then peaked at #53, two years after its original release, and was eventually certified "Gold" by the BPI in 1984 for 100,000 copies sold.

The titular lead single "Quiet Life" was released exclusively in Japan by Victor Records, while in the rest of the world, Hansa chose to promote the album with the standalone single "I Second That Emotion" instead. Neither single was commercially successful. Eighteen months later, in line with Japan's increasing popularity and media profile, Hansa retroactively released "Quiet Life" as a single in the UK and Ireland in 1981. The single reached #19 on the UK Singles Chart, Japan's highest chart placing at that point.

A second retroactive single, "All Tomorrow's Parties", was issued by Hansa in February 1983, two months after Japan permanently disbanded, and three years after the original album release. It charted at #38 in the UK.

The album appears in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Original planned track listing

# "All Tomorrow's Parties"
# "Fall in Love with Me"
# "Alien"
# "Quiet Life"
# "The Other Side of Life"
# "Despair"
# "In Vogue"
# "Halloween"
# "A Foreign Place"

* As described in the notes that accompany the 2004 reissue. This original track listing was intended to form a travelogue, but was rejected for something more commercial. The band ultimately dropped "A Foreign Place" from the track listing, but it was released on the 1981 UK single of "Quiet Life", and then on the 1984 compilation Exorcising Ghosts (although it was dropped from the CD version apart from on Japanese pressings). At one point, the band intended "European Son" and "Life in Tokyo" to be part of the travelogue (evidenced in their lyrics), but they were not included on the album.
