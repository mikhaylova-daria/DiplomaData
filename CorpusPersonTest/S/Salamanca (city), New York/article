Climate


 History 

What is now known as the city of Salamanca was originally two separate communities, one on Little Valley Creek and the other on Great Valley Creek; the westernmost one of the two was called "Hemlock", a name derived from the fact that there were numerous hemlock trees throughout the surrounding majestic mountains of the Mighty Ohi:yo'. Hemlock was later renamed "West Salamanca" and (although it was marked on road signs as late as the 1990s) was eventually incorporated into a single city of Salamanca. The city itself was incorporated in 1913. 

At one time the city was a thriving railroad hub, with the Erie Railroad, the Baltimore & Ohio (later Conrail), and the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway all having facilities there. Generations of Salamanca residents worked for the railroads, and the Salamanca Rail Museum was opened in the former BR&P depot in 1984 to house the archives.

The majority of the city, with the exception of a northeastern spur along Great Valley Creek, was constructed on the Allegany Indian Reservation held by the Seneca Nation of New York, as established in various treaties. Under the nation's policy, non-Seneca residents are barred from owning real property on the reservation, and non-Senecas can only lease the property from the Seneca Nation. The previous leases had had only nominal payments and only covered the actual land; improvements (i.e., buildings and houses) were still considered to be outright owned by the non-native citizens. When the leases expired in the early 1990s, the nation attempted to raise the cost of the lease and asserted that not only the land, but the improvements were also subject to the native lease. Numerous people living in the city did not agree on the amount of lease payments or the legitimacy of the Senecas' absolute ownership claim, and this caused bitterness, lawsuits, and appeals to government officials. In the end, a federal law placing the improvements under Seneca jurisdiction was passed, the new leases were put into effect, and fifteen households were seized and their owners evicted from their homes for refusing to sign the lease. The current lease is in effect until 2030, with an option to extend until 2070.

Despite the lack of ownership, leased land held by non-Senecas is subject to property tax, which the lessee must pay to the city, Cattaraugus County and the Salamanca City Central School District, whereas Seneca-owned land is exempt under the Treaty of Buffalo Creek. Once a Seneca acquires the land, it is taken off the tax rolls; for this reason, the city of Salamanca does not auction off abandoned properties on the reservation in a property tax auction, for fear that the Senecas will buy the land and take it off the tax rolls.

One of the casualties of the ownership system was the Ray Evans Seneca Theater, which has recently been upgraded into a center for the performing arts focusing on local live theater.

Casino gambling
The Seneca Nation opened a gambling casino in Salamanca in May 2004. About 1,000 new jobs were created by the current casino operation, creating a housing shortage for the influx of workers. The 25% share of the revenue going to the city and county have enabled the city to try to refurbish its worn-down image.

However, noticeable, significant change has not yet occurred in the city, with new construction in only a few select areas. Main Street and US Route 219 (which runs through the city) remains largely untouched, with little to no renovation, and is populated by cigarette, tobacco, coffee shops, gas stations and empty storefronts. Some have criticized the current trend of developing the "New Salamanca" as a tax free cigarette/gas haven. The Seneca Nation has made efforts to reverse this trend and established an economic development corporation to encourage diversification of the city's businesses in 2011. Furthermore, the casino payments were stopped in late 2010 in a dispute with the state over whether or not it had violated the exclusivity terms of the agreement by opening racinos elsewhere in western New York (the payments resumed in 2013).

The contentious relations between Seneca and non-Seneca residents led columnist Selena Zito to dub the city of Salamanca a "failed American city" in a 2011 column.
