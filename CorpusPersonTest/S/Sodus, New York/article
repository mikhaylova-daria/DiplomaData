Sodus is a town in Wayne County, New York, USA. The population was 8,384 at the 2010 census. The town takes its name from a native word for the bay in the eastern part of the town: "Assorodus," meaning "silvery water."

The Town of Sodus is on the north border of the county and is midway between Rochester and Syracuse.

History
The Town of Sodus was formed in 1789 from the older "District of Sodus" while still part of Ontario County. The town's Adam territory was substantially reduced by the formation of newer towns in the county: Williamson (1802) and Lyons (1811).

The town contains a village named Sodus and another named Sodus Point. Sodus Point was settled around 1794 because of a road constructed from Palmyra, but the first settlers did not arrive at the Village of Sodus until about 1809.

In 1813, the British attacked and burned the village of Sodus Point.

A lighthouse was erected in 1825 to mark the shoreline.

Members of the Shakers settled in the early town, but moved away, when they believed Sodus was becoming too worldly. 
Sodus claims to be the birthplace of Arbor Day, a holiday established by the efforts of Sodus Center native Edward C. Delano.

Sodus is home to Heluva Good!, specializing in cheeses, chip dips, sour cream and condiments. It is a subsidiary of HP Hood LLC, headquartered in Lynnfield, Massachusetts. A Heluva Good! Country Store is located near the hamlet of Wallington.

The Preston-Gaylord Cobblestone Farmhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.
