Stockbridge is a city in Henry County, Georgia, United States with a population of 25,637 as of the 2010 census.

Stockbridge is part of the Atlanta metropolitan area.

History
The area was settled in 1829 when Concord Methodist Church was organized near present today Old Stagecoach Road. It was granted a post office on April 5, 1847 named for a traveling Professor, Levi Stockbridge, who passed through the area many times before the Post Office was built. He was said to be well known and respected in his namesake community. Others contend that the city was named after Thomas Stock, who was State Surveyor and President of the Georgia State Senate in the 1820s.

In 1881, the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad was to pass through Stockbridge between Macon and Atlanta. The settlers who owned the land about Old Stockbridge asked so much for their land that two prominent Atlanta citizens, John W. Grant and George W. Adair, bought a tract about a mile south of Old Stockbridge and offered lots at a reasonable price. Here the railroad built their depot and many lots were sold. The depot was located about north of what is now North Henry Blvd but was destroyed by the Southern Railway in the early 1980s.

Stockbridge was incorporated as a town in 1895 and as a city August 6, 1920.

The Aaron and Margaret Parker Jr. House and Walden-Turner House in Stockbridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Naming mystery
On May 6, 1992, Mayor Rudy Kelley received a letter from Mr. John Stockbridge of South Carolina requesting a letter of "Greeting" from the City of Stockbridge to the attendees of the first reunion of the Stockbridge family. In his letter, he mentioned that he grew up in Georgia and had been told as a child that the City of Stockbridge was named after his great-great-grandfather Levi Stockbridge who traveled back and forth from the north to his property in Florida and stopped here on his journey.

Levi Stockbridge was born on March 13, 1820, and fits the time frame just prior to the Civil War. Levi would have been 27 years of age when Stockbridge was assigned a post office in 1847.

Until May 6, 1992, there had never been a name other than Professor Stockbridge. At that time, Levi Stockbridge was mentioned as the person for whom the city may have been named.

It is not certain that Levi Stockbridge was the individual for whom the citizens of the community named their post office and village. However, through John Stockbridge’s letters and many conversations with him, it is believed that this is the rightful Professor Stockbridge who had been unknown for 146 years.

Recent history

Eminent domain controversy
In late 2005 the City of Stockbridge engaged in a highly controversial preemptive use of eminent domain to buy over of land near the current city hall running along East Atlanta Road. The City reportedly wanted to build a new city hall, park/square, and a small tract of land for new and more desirable business to incorporate a new image for the city. Stockbridge became the focus of national news and was also one of the largest issues in the 2006 Georgia General Assembly and their efforts to prevent abuse of eminent domain.

Many of the citizens of Stockbridge and Henry County were surprised by the apparent abuse of eminent domain by the city. Early in 2006, a protest was organized by the NAACP and supported by the Republican and Libertarian parties from the county. Syndicated Atlanta talk show host Neal Boortz said during his show, "Private property rights are dead in Stockbridge, Georgia" and called members of the Stockbridge City Council, "sorry bastards."


The Henry County Board of Commissioners took a stance on the issue by unanimously approving a non-binding resolution that the county would not take land for economic development purposes. Although the county legally has no say of what the City of Stockbridge can do with its land and its use of eminent domain. Many have said it was just a political strategy being that Henry County has shown recently in voting history to be one of the most conservative counties in the Atlanta metro area.

The conflict between the city and the property owners came to an end on February 2, 2007 as the Georgia Court of Appeals threw out the condemnation. Only one store, a local florist, beat the eminent domain and was allowed to keep its store and property. www.henryherald.com/local/local_story_033222054.html An infamous brick fence was erected around the florist shop to separate it from the new City Hall. It is well known in the area for its awkward shape.

However, in October 2009 the battle between the owner of the florist shop and the city started up again. When the florist shop put up signs for a mayoral and city council candidates who opposed the eminent domain abuse, workers at city hall started putting up bales of hay to block the sign. When a local Television reporter asked who ordered the bales of hay to be put up, city workers refused to comment. www.wsbtv.com/news/21430582/detail.html

New City Hall
After February 2007 the city had new plans drawn up to build the new city hall. The plans call for the new city hall and park and green space to all be built around the Stockbridge Florist shop that started the now famous Eminent Domain lawsuit.

The city says that the new development will strengthen the old and worn down downtown business district. The Stockbridge City Manager Ted Strickland, said that the new city hall was absolutely necessary, because some current city employees are working out of closets and supply rooms. www.henryherald.com/archivesearch/local_story_044222826.html

During interviews with city workers, they complained that it was interesting how the city could "spend 2 million dollars on a water fountain" but could not give its employees a mere $0.50 raise. After being more than 1 million dollars over budget and 2 years behind on the project the new city hall was opened in August 2009.
