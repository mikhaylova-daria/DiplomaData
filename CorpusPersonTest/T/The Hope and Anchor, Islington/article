The Hope and Anchor is a pub on Upper Street, in the London Borough of Islington, and first opened its' doors in 1880. During the mid-1970s it was one of the first Pubs to embrace the emergent, but brief, phenomenon of pub rock. With the decline of this movement, the pub went on to become a leading venue in the punk rock movement. The Hope and Anchor is still an operational pub and live music venue today, owned and operated by the Greene King Brewing Company. Venue Facilities have been improved via refurbishments over the years.

 History 
The Hope and Anchor can trace its' history back to when the building was built in 1880. When the Tally Ho in Kentish Town decided to switch from showcasing Rock Music to Irish Music, the Hope and Anchor became the venue to go to in North London. The nights grew and developed, under the stewardship of Managers Fred Grainger and Dave Robinson, both of whom later moved on to other things (Fred; to open a Club in Brighton, Dave; to co-found a Record Label.

In January 1976, the Venue was acquired by Albion Management and Agency, who installed John Eichler as the Landlord. In the light of numerous threats of closure, John organised various benefits in order to keep the pub open, with named bands returning to the pub and performing for only expenses. Ian Grant of Albion narrowed down a long list to a final 22 bands - all of which had played at the pub at one time or another previously.

The Hope & Anchor Front Row Festival, which took place between Tuesday 22 November and Thursday 15 December 1977, featured numerous pub rock, punk, and new wave groups. The recordings were issued as a live double album of the same name, which reached No 28 in the UK Albums Chart.

The actual performance space at the Hope and Anchor was, at the time, a spartan and rather grubby basement space, alternately dank or overheated, and always smoky, but this in many ways suited the anarchic ideals of late-1970s live music. It was here that The Stranglers recorded their album Live at the Hope and Anchor.

 Layout 

The Venue is made up of 5 Floors, of which only 3 are accessible to the Public

 Basement 

The Basement is the famous Live Music Venue, and still operates as one today. It can be hired out by various promoters and groups for music/comedy shows, as well as doubling as a rehearsal space during the day. It has a bar at the rear of the space (Where the stage was originally located until it was moved in a refurb) next to the Soundbooth. The Maximum Legal Capacity is 80 Persons, down from its' previous maximum of 120. The Basement also contains very basic and dingy Male and Female Toilets, next to the Emergency Fire Escape. The Stage is located where the original Bar Area was, between the Cellar and Storeroom Doors. At some point in its long history, the Venue was converted to run as both a Live Music Venue and as a Recording Studio, although the latter functionality has since been lost.

 Ground Floor 

The Ground Floor contains the Main Bar, and a space for 120 people. There is a staircase by the Main Door (Upper Street Entrance) leading to the Basement. The Side Door leads to Islington Park Street. A staircase at the Rear provides access to the First floor. The Ground Floor has a Jukebox and Fruit Machine. The walls are lined with posters and Vinyls of tickets and albums recorded at gigs there.

 First Floor 

The First Floor contains both Male and Female Toilets. There used to be an Upstairs Bar located in the area here, which was later converted into a Pool Hall, as well as a Lounge Bar. It then became a Private-Hire Function Room. Since November 2013 The Hope Theatre is housed on the second floor of the pub. It is an experimental theatre started by the King's Head Theatre aiming at giving stage to new writing.

The rest of the building has no public access.

. The pub was also featured in the 1980 film, Breaking Glass.
