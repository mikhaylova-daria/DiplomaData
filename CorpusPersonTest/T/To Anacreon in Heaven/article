"The Anacreontic Song", also known by its incipit "To Anacreon In Heaven", was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. The tune was later used by several writers as a setting for their patriotic lyrics. These included two songs by Francis Scott Key, most famously his poem "Defence of Fort McHenry". The latter combination became known as "The Star-Spangled Banner" and was adopted as the national anthem of the United States of America, in 1931.

The Anacreontic Society
The Anacreontic Society was a gentlemen's club of the kind that sprang up in London in the late eighteenth century. Dedicated to the ancient Greek poet Anacreon, renowned for his drinking song and odes to love, the Society was founded "about the year 1766" and originally had 25 members (later expanding to 80). The members, who paid the three guineas subscription fee, were generally of "fashionable society" including "several noblemen and gentlemen of the first distinction". Each member was entitled to admit one guest. The Society met twelve times a year, starting in late November, and continuing every other Wednesday evening. Each meeting began at half past seven with a lengthy concert, featuring "the best performers in London" (who were made honorary members of the Society). Following the concert, the members adjourned to another room for a meal, after which the members would participate in "catches and glees", "songs", "miniature puppet-shews", and "everything that mirth can suggest".

At its inception, in 1766, the Society met in various tavern, and then the London Coffee House on Ludgate Hill. It subsequently moved to the Crown and Anchor tavern in The Strand in order to accommodate an expansion in its membership from 25 to 40.

A musical high-point of the society occurred in January 1791, when Josef Haydn attended a meeting at which the twelve-year-old Johann Hummel performed, "astonishing the company with a most admirable performance of a favourite English ballet, with variations, on the harpsichord".

The Society came to an end after the Duchess of Devonshire attended one of its meetings. Because "some of the comic songs were not exactly calculated for the entertainment of ladies, the singers were restrained; which displeasing many of the members, they resigned one after another; and a general meeting being called, the society was dissolved." It is not clear exactly when this incident occurred, but in October 1792 it was reported that "The Anacreontick Society meets no more; it has long been struggling with symptoms of internal decay".

The original role of the Song
An early reference to the Anacreontic Song is found in the long-unpublished journals of gentleman-composer John Marsh (1752-1828). Writing of December 11, 1773, he recalls: 

Another reference is found in the long-unpublished "Recollections" of Richard John Samuel Stevens (1757-1837). In this passage, Stevens is speaking of the year 1777:


Parke, writing in the early nineteenth century, recalls: 

The Anacreontic Song served as the "constitutional song" of the Society. After the initial concert and meal, the Song would be sung in order to open the after-supper, more light-hearted part of proceedings. The verses, which are difficult to sing because of their wide range, would be sung by a solo singer, with the entire Society joining in the refrain. Although it is often described as a "drinking song", Lichtenwanger states that To Anacreon in Heaven "was not a barroom ballad, a drinking ditty to be chorused with glasses swung in rhythm", but "convivial, ... in a special and stately way".

Composition and authorship

Words
The early publications do not name the composer of the music, but they ascribe the lyrics of the Song to the Society's president, Ralph Tomlinson. Tomlinson was baptized in Plemstall, Cheshire, in 1744; by 1766 he is recorded as a lawyer practising in London. Tomlinson likely became President of the Society following the death of the previous President, George Bellas, in January 1776. He died in March 1778 at the age of thirty-three.

Music
The identity of the composer was a subject of controversy until the discovery, in the mid-twentieth century, of a passage in a then-unpublished manuscript of Recollections written by Richard John Samuel Stevens (1757-1837), a member of the Anacreontic Society. Writing of the year 1777, Stevens recalled:



In this passage, Stevens identifies the composer as John Stafford Smith (1750-1836). Smith, the son of the organist of Gloucester Cathedral, was sent at a young age to sing in the Chapel Royal, and thereafter soon established himself in the capital. Like Stevens himself, Smith was a young professional musician active primarily in the chapels and churches of London. Smith was a published composer by 1772, and he won two composition prizes from the London Catch Club in 1773. Both Smith and Stevens were likely among the "honorary members" of the Anacreontic Society who played in its concerts without having to pay the subscription fee; Smith is probably the "leader" identified by Marsh in his recollection of 1773 excerpted above.


In his Fifth Book of Canzonets (1799), Smith included an arrangement of the Anacreontic Song, adding the ambiguous notation "harmonized by the Author". Apart from this, there is no evidence that Smith ever publicly claimed to have written the music (publications of the Song during Smith's lifetime did not name the composer).

It remains puzzling why Smith did not make more effort to associate himself with the Song, especially when its popularity increased after the music was set to other texts (notably the Defence of Fort McHenry—see below). Until the discovery of Stevens's Recollections there was some controversy over whether Smith was in fact the composer of the Song. However, no alternative story for the music's origins (whether as the work of a different composer or as a pre-existing tune) ever gained a consensus among historians. Lichtenwanger suggests that "perhaps Smith composed the song for Tomlinson for money, for a flat fee, which meant yielding his legal rights in it to Tomlinson or the Society".

 Death of Ralph Tomlinson.
 August 1, 1778 Words of the Anacreontic Song (earlier version, with references to the meeting-place at the London Coffee House) published in The Vocal magazine. Attributed to "Ralph Tomlinson, Esq.". March 1780 Words of the Anacreontic Song (later version) published in The London Magazine. Attribute to "the late R. Tomlinson". May 1780 Anonymous "History of the Anacreontic Society" published in The Gentleman's Magazine. Includes the words of the song (later version), attributed to "poor Ralph Tomlinson, their late President". Some time between 1777 and 1781 First Longman & Broderip edition of the Song with music and text (later version) published. Words attributed to "Ralph Tomlinson Esq. late President of that Society"; music unattributed. Refers to the Song as "Sung at the Crown And Anchor Tavern in the Strand". 1783 First known dated publication of the music of the Song, in The Vocal Enchantress. Both words and music are unattributed.1792 Anacreontic Society "meets no more" 1799 John Stafford Smith publishes his Fifth Book of Canzonets, with a possible oblique claim to authorship of the Song 21 September 1836 Death of John Stafford Smith.

The date of the composition of the Song is uncertain. It cannot predate the foundation of the Anacreontic Society (around 1766). Lichtenwanger suggests a composition date as late as 1776; but if the Marsh journal is accurate then the Song must have existed by December 1773. The age of John Stafford Smith may also be of interest; Smith was in his mid-teens in 1766, while by 1773 he was in his early twenties and a published, prize-winning composer.

Publication

The lyrics of the song were published in The Vocal Magazine, 1778, attributed to "Ralph Tomlinson, Esq.". The music, along with the words, was published in The Vocal Enchantress, a collection published in 1783. There are also various undated publications of the music which likely date to the early 1780s. None of these publications name the composer of the music.

Particular interest attaches to the first Longman & Broderip edition of the music, published between 1777 and 1781. This was likely the first publication of the music and the official edition from which others were copied. Broderip, a partner at the firm, is known to have attended meetings of the Society.

The earlier version of the lyrics
In the first known version of the lyrics, as published The Vocal magazine of 1778, there are two significant textual discrepancies from later publications.

* In the second verse, A fig for Parnassus! To Rowley's we'll fly; appears in place of Away to the Sons of Anacreon we'll fly
* In the third verse, To the hill of old Lud will incontinent flee, appears in place of From Helicon's banks will incontinent flee,

The two replaced lines refer to the Society's earlier meeting-place at the London Coffee-House, which was situated on Ludgate Hill and seems to have occupied the same premises as Rowley and Leech, a wine merchant.

Music

Subsequent history

The song, through its bawdy lyrics, gained popularity in London and elsewhere beyond the Anacreontic Society. New lyrics were also fashioned for it, including several patriotic titles in the United States. The most popular of these at the time was Robert Treat Paine Jr.'s Adams and Liberty (1798).

"The Star-Spangled Banner"
Francis Scott Key wrote "Defence of Fort McHenry" during the War of 1812, while detained on a British ship during the night of September 13, 1814, as the British forces bombarded the American fort. Key specifically wrote the lyrics with this familiar patriotic tune in mind, just as he had done with an earlier set of his lyrics, "When the Warrior Returns", in which he had made similar use of "star-spangled banner" imagery. Later retitled "The Star-Spangled Banner", Key's lyrics, set to Stafford Smith's music, became a well-known and recognized patriotic song throughout the United States, and was officially designated as the U.S. national anthem on March 3, 1931. The setting of new lyrics to an existing tune is called a contrafactum.
