Under the Sun is the second album by Australian rock group Paul Kelly & The Coloured Girls and was originally released in December 1987 by Mushroom Records. In the North American and European markets, it was released by A&M Records in 1988 with the band credited as Paul Kelly & The Messengers, with a different track order and listing.

On the Australian albums charts it peaked at #19 with the single "To Her Door" peaking at #14. Another single, "Dumb Things" peaked at #36 in early 1989, on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts; it reached #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was included in the soundtrack for the 1988 Yahoo Serious film Young Einstein. 

"To Her Door" won an ARIA Award in 1988 for 'Best Video' directed by Claudia Castle. In 2001, the Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) listed the Top 30 Australian songs of all time, including "To Her Door" written by Kelly.

Background
After relocating from Melbourne to Sydney in 1985, Paul Kelly began to play and record with a full-time band, which included Michael Armiger on bass guitar, Michael Barclay on drums, Steve Connolly on guitar, eventually bassist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull joined. Through a joke based on Lou Reed's song "Walk on the Wild Side", the band became known as Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. In September 1986 the band released their debut double LP Gossip. Due to possible racist connotations the band changed its name, for international releases, to Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They made an American tour, initially supporting Crowded House and then head-lining, travelling across the United States by bus. Jon Schofield replaced Armiger on bass guitar, Chris Coyne on tenor saxophone and Chris Wilson on harmonica

On the Australian albums charts it peaked at #19 with the single "To Her Door" peaking at #14. First single from the album, "Bradman" had been released in January 1987 as a double-A side with "Leaps and Bounds" from Gossip but had little chart success. The third and fourth singles, "Forty Miles to Saturday Night" and "Don't Stand So Close to the Window" also had little chart success. Another single, "Dumb Things" peaked at #36 in early 1989, on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts; it reached #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was included in the soundtrack for the 1988 Yahoo Serious film Young Einstein. 

In 1988, "To Her Door" won an ARIA Award for 'Best Video' directed by Claudia Castle. In 2001, the Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) listed the Top 30 Australian songs of all time, including "To Her Door" written by Kelly.
