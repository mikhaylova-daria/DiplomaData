History
The settlement of Vöhringen may have developed by the 5th or 6th century, when the Alamanni migrating from the Danube settled the Swabian river valleys. Veringen, as it is called in several 12th-century documents, underwent several changes of overlordship in the 15th century and finally became Bavarian in 1756 under Elector Max Joseph of Bavaria, earlier than the neighbouring settlements.

Vöhringen was decisively changed by industrialisation beginning in 1864, when factory owner Philipp Jakob Wieland bought the local mill, its attached workshop and the water power to run them. Wieland Works are now known worldwide and an important presence in the town.

Vöhringen became a town on 25 June 1977. At that time it already included the settlements of Illerberg, Illerzell and Thal.

Incorporated former settlements
Illerzell
The formerly independent settlement of Illerzell, with more than 1,300 inhabitants, is around 3 km northwest of Vöhringen on the floor of the Iller Valley. It was incorporated into Vöhringen on 1 July 1972.

Illerberg und Thal
Illerberg, with more than 1,700 inhabitants, and Thal, with around 600, are located about 2 km east of Vöhringen and are still largely agricultural villages. In existence since the 6th or 7th centuries, they were long associated under a single overlord and have grown together to form a single settlement; the two were administratively united on 22 November 1970 and were incorporated into Vöhringen on 1 January 1976.
