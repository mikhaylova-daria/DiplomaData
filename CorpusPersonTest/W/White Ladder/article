White Ladder is the multi-platinum selling fourth studio album by British singer-songwriter David Gray, first released in November 1998. Worldwide sales of the album stand at 7 million.

Background
The self-financed album was recorded in Gray's London apartment. To support the album, Gray toured the United States with the Dave Matthews Band, whose lead singer Dave Matthews released White Ladder in the United States on his label ATO in 2000 as the label's first release. Following the album's success, he toured the US and UK extensively between 2000–01 to promote the album.

A hidden track, "Through to Myself", can be found in the pregap of the original 1998 IHT Records release (by rewinding from the start of "Please Forgive Me"). The US CD release does not include the secret track, but instead includes the audio bonus track "Babylon II", as well as an enhanced section which includes a mini-documentary with a live performance of "Babylon", a brief biography and web links. The Japanese release includes the bonus track "Over My Head", which also appears as a B-side on the 1999 "Babylon" single.

The cover of "Say Hello Wave Goodbye", originally by Soft Cell, features additional lines from the Van Morrison songs, "Madame George" and "Into the Mystic".

Commercial reception
White Ladder was originally released on Gray's own label IHT Records in November 1998. However, it was only after its re-release in 2000 on ATO Records and the hit single "Babylon" that it sold 100,000 copies in Ireland alone, making it number one for six weeks, and it remains the biggest-selling album in Ireland. The album was No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, two years and five months after its original release, spending a total of 151 weeks on the chart. Aside from "Please Forgive Me," which charted at No. 72 on the UK Singles Chart, all other single releases charted within the Top 20: the re-released "Please Forgive Me" charted at No. 18, and "Say Hello Wave Goodbye" and "Sail Away" peaked at No. 26.

In the United States, the album peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard 200, spending a whole year on the chart. The album earned Gray a nomination in the United States at the 44th Grammy Awards for Best New Artist.

Reflecting on White Ladders success in 2010, Gray stated: "I still pinch myself when I think about it. That record will be there for ever. It just connected in such a big way with people. ... It was the period that came after that was difficult. ... I'm sort of seen as a pop artist. I'm dismissed as slight, I'd say, because of White Ladder."

White Ladder was the fifth best selling UK album of the 2000s. It has sold 2,940,575 units in the UK by 24 July 2011.

A total of five singles were released from the album: "This Year's Love" in March 1999 (re-issued in March 2001), "Babylon" in July 1999 (re-issued in June 2000), "Please Forgive Me" in November 1999 (re-issued in October 2000), "Sail Away" in July 2001, and a shortened edit of "Say Hello Wave Goodbye" in December 2001.
