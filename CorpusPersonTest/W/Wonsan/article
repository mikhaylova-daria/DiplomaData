Wŏnsan is a port city and naval base located in Kangwon Province, North Korea, on the westernmost shore of the Sea of Japan (East Korean Sea) and the provincial capital. The port was opened by occupying Japanese forces in 1880. Before the Korean War , it fell within the jurisdiction of the then South Hamgyong Province, and during that war, it was the location of the Blockade of Wonsan. The population of the city was estimated at 331,000 in 2000. Notable people from Wŏnsan include Kim Ki Nam, diplomat and Secretary of the Korean Workers' Party. Economically, the city is home to several major factories.

In 2013, it was announced that Wonsan will be converted into a summer destination with resorts and entertainment.

 History 
Wonsan opened as a trade port in 1880. Its original name was Wŏnsanjin (元山津), but it was also known by the Russian name of Port Lazarev (Lazaref). Under Japanese rule (1910–45) it was called Gensan (元山). In 1914 the Pyongwon Line and Gyeongwon Line railways were opened, connecting the city to Pyongyang (then known as Heijo) and Seoul (then Keijo or Kyongsong). Thus, the city gradually developed into the eastern product distribution center. Under the Japanese occupation, the city was heavily industrialized and served as an import point in the distribution of trade between Korea and mainland Japan.

Provincial borders
Wŏnsan used to be in South Hamgyong, but when provincial borders were redrawn in 1946, it joined the northern half of Kangwŏn (which had been split at the 38th parallel north into a zone under Soviet control in the north and one of American control in the south in 1945) and became its capital, as Kangwŏn's traditional capitals Wonju (1395–1895) and Chuncheon (since 1896) both were south of the 38th parallel and south of the Military Demarcation Line that replaced the 38th parallel as a border in 1953. It was heavily bombed by the United Nations during the Korean War's Blockade of Wonsan. In fact, according to the official US Navy history, Wŏnsan was under continuous siege and bombardment by the American navy from March 1951 until July 27, 1953, making it the longest siege in modern American naval history. By war's end the city was a vast shell. It was also captured by American and South Korean troops in 10 October 1950 but liberated by Chinese ones in 9 December 1950.

Wŏnsan serves as the administrative center of Kangwŏn Province.
