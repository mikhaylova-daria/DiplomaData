In 1956, following the national strategy, the major portion of Jiao Tong University moved to Xi'an, Shaanxi and later became Xi'an Jiaotong University. The remaining portion in Shanghai later became Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Some alumni of the original Jiaotong University (Chiao Tung University) established (or refer as "re-established") the National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War and the government of Republic of China's relocation to Taiwan.

History
The predecessor of Xi'an Jiaotong University is Nanyang Public School that was founded in Shanghai in 1896; in 1905, it was transferred to the commercial department and was renamed High Industrial School; in 1906, it was under the command of postal transmission department. It was renamed Shanghai High Industrial School of Postal Transmission Department.

In 1911, Xinhai Revolution broke out. The school was renamed Grand Naiyang University. After the Republic of China was founded in 1912, it was managed by the traffic department and was renamed Shanghai Special Industrial School of Traffic Department. In 1921, Jiaotong University was set up by merging Shanghai Special Industrial School, Tangshan Special Industrial School, Beiping Railway Management School and Beiping Post Telecommunication School. The university was called Shanghai School of Jiaotong University; in 1922, Jiaotong University had three schools. The original Shanghai School was renamed Nanyang University of Traffic Department. In 1927, it was renamed the First Jiaotong University of the Traffic Department; In 1928, the Guomin Government issued "Organizational Outline of Jiaotong University". The three schools in Shanghai, Tangshan and Beiping were all called Jiaotong University. The headquarters was in Shanghai. In the same year, it was transferred to the railway department.

During the anti-Japanese War, the university was moved to the French Concession and in 1940 the state-run branch of Jiaotong University was set up in Chongqing. In 1941, to prevent the Wang puppet government from taking over the university, it was run continually in the name of Private Nanyang University. In 1942, the Wang government took over Shanghai School. So the Education Department of Guomin Government chose Chongqing Branch as the headquarters of Jiaotong University. After the anti-Japanese War was won, Chongqing headquarter went back to Shanghai and merged with Shanghai School. In 1946, the name of state-run Jiaotong University was recovered.

In 1956, following the national strategy, the major portion of Jiao Tong University moved to Xi'an, Shaanxi and later became Xi'an Jiaotong University in 1959. In the same year, Xi'an Jiaotong University was listed as the key university in China. Later, it became one of a few universities built according to the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" and "Eighth Five-Year Plan." It was one of the universities that entered the construction of "211 project" of China. In September, it was determined to be one of a few universities that had the target to build world famous high level University. In April 2000, approved by the State Council, Xi'an Medical University, Shannxi Institute of Finance and Economics and Xi'an Jiaotong University were merged and formed the new Xi'an Jiaotong University.
