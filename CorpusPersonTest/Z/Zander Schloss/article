Zander Schloss (born August 7, 1958) is an American musician, actor and composer. He is perhaps best known as bass player for The Circle Jerks and The Weirdos and for his contributions to a number of independent (cult status) feature films. His first screen appearance was as "Kevin the Nerd" in Repo Man. He went on to appear in a number of Alex Cox films as well as significant musical contributions in other Cox features such as Sid and Nancy (1986), Straight to Hell (1987), Walker (1987), El Patrullero (1991) and The Winner (1996).

Career
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Schloss joined the Circle Jerks in 1984 after a two year stint with funk band The Juicy Bananas who contributed to the Repo Man sound track. He left the Jerks after two albums to join up with former Clash front man Joe Strummer in London as musical director and lead guitarist/multi-instrumentalist on several tours (with Latino Rockabilly War), solo albums and sound tracks. Schloss re-joined the Circle Jerks for their 1990 U.S. tour and continued to tour and record with the Jerks until 2010.

Schloss has also worked with The Weirdos, Too Free Stooges and Thelonious Monster.

He was called for a Tour of Australia with Red Hot Chili Peppers after guitarist John Frusciante left in the early '90s, but did not join the band.

Zander worked on Latin projects El Patrullero in 1991 as composer and recorded with Robi Draco Rosa on his album Frio in 1994.

He then formed the group Low and Sweet Orchestra calling upon old Thelonious Monster cohort Mike Martt, The Pogues accordionist James Fearnley and brothers Dermot and Kieran Mulroney and in 1996 released their debut record, Goodbye to All That on Interscope Records.

During the mid-'90s Schloss also worked with Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver in The Magnificent Bastards and again with The Circle Jerks for their major label debut and final studio album Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities (1995, LP, Mercury Records).

In December 2007, Schloss appeared with his 14-piece band The Wilderness Years at The Key Club, in tribute to friend and collaborator Joe Strummer.

In 2010, Schloss released the album, Walk Thee Invisible with musical partner and collaborator Sean Wheeler produced by Gus Seyffert.
Wheeler and Schloss have opened for The Pogues, Mark Lanegan, Masters of Reality, Flogging Molly, Mariachi El Bronx and X (American band).

Schloss also works as a studio session player and composer on various film and commercial projects.
