Zarley Bennett Zalapski (born April 22, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman.

Playing career
Zalapski's career started with the Fort Saskatchewan Traders of the AJHL. In his first season with the Traders, Zalapski tallied 70 points in 67 games, including 17 goals. Zalapski spent the next two years playing with the Canadian National Team. Zalapski was picked 4th in the 1st round by the Penguins in the 1986 entry draft. He has tallied 99 goals, and 285 assists, for a total of 384 points in his 637 games in the NHL. He also registered 684 penalty minutes.

He was a member of the Canadian Olympic Hockey team in the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary, Alberta. Canada would end up missing the medal podium and finished in 4th place. Although Canada lost their first game in the medal round, Zalapski played a key role in the team's victories over West Germany and Czechoslovakia.

After his 11 year career in the NHL playing for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Hartford Whalers, Calgary Flames, Montreal Canadiens, and Philadelphia Flyers, he then played for teams in hockey leagues in Germany, Italy, and most recently Switzerland. On December 2, 2008, Zalapski's skate accidentally made a deep cut Genève-Servette HC's player Jérôme Bonnet.

After the completion of the 2009–10 NLB season, Zalapski retired.

Personal
Zalapski's unusual first name comes as a result of his father, being a golf enthusiast naming him after professional golfer Kermit Zarley. In 2006 he became a Swiss citizen through marriage.
