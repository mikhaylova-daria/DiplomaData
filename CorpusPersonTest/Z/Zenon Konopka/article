"I can't help that I fell in love with the little guy ... the guy's pretty cool. He just chills around, has his litter box, does his business there and he's pretty soothing to come home to."

Zenon also has a specially made hockey jersey made for Hoppy for each team he plays for. 

Konopka is of Polish descent. His father was born in Poland. His mother is a native of Buffalo, New York. Konopka's sister, Cynthia, sang the national anthems at Scotiabank Place before the Senators' game on January 16, 2012.
