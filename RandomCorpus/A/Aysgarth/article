Aysgarth is a village and civil parish in Wensleydale, in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England. The village is in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, about south-west from Richmond and west of the County Town of Northallerton.

History

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Echescard. The topynomy is derived from the combination of the Old Norse words eiki, meaning Oak, and skar√∞, meaning Open space giving Oak trees in open space.

At the time of the Norman invasion, the manor was held by Cnut, son of Karli. Afterwards the manor was in the possession of Count Alan of Brittany, who granted lordship to Geoffrey of Swaffham. By the 13th century, the manor was in the hands of the Burgh family of Hackforth. The manor descended with the manor of Hackforth until 1480 at which time they were conveyed to the Crown in the person of Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Some lands in the manor in the 13th century came into the hands of the lords of Middleham and then followed the descent of the manor of Thoralby.

The village's railway station, part of the Hawes Branch of the North Eastern Railway, opened in 1878 and closed in April 1954. 

The George and Dragon Inn in Aysgarth dates from the 17th century when it was a coaching inn and is now a Grade II listed building. Local real ale from the Black Sheep Brewery and the Yorkshire Dales Brewing Company is served.

On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the village.

Aysgarth Falls

This is a triple flight of waterfalls on the River Ure over a one-mile stretch. The falls are fast flowing, especially during wet weather, as thousands of gallons of water cascade over the series of broad limestone steps. Aysgarth Falls is a popular tourist attraction and has been the subject of works by Ruskin, Turner and Wordsworth, who all visited the area. The upper fall was featured in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.
