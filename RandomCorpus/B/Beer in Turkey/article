Beer is a very popular alcoholic beverage in Turkey. Commonly, lager type beers are popular.

History
Beer has existed as a beverage in Anatolia since the Sumerian civilization. Archaeological findings showing that Sumer people knew how to ferment beer. Early Turks in Anatolia fermented boza which was much like the Kvas.

The modern history of beer in Turkey started with the Ottoman Empire. During certain periods in the Ottoman Empire, drinking alcoholic beverages was forbidden in some cities, but many small boza producers in Istanbul produced boza with a high alcohol level like beer. Beer was first produced and served at Erzurum by some small Armenian producers in "beer gardens" . The first modern production of beer in Turkey started with the Bomonti beer factory in Istanbul in 1894 by the Helvatian Bomonti brothers. There were many pubs and bars in Istanbul, Izmir, and Thessaloniki. Production of beer in the Ottoman Empire was 1.2 billion liters in 1894. This increased to 9.9 billion liters in 1913–1914.

Atatürk, the first president of the Turkish Republic, founded an ale factory in Ankara. İsmet İnönü, the first prime minister of Turkey, worked to improve the old Bomonti Beer Company. This created the first beer competition in Turkey.
