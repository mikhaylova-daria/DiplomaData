Buffalo Springfield is the self-titled debut album by folk rock band Buffalo Springfield, released in late 1966. It was originally released in both mono and stereo versions as Atco (SD) 33-200, but when the single "For What It's Worth" became a hit, the album was re-released as Atco (SD) 33-200A adding it but dropping "Baby Don't Scold Me". "Baby Don't Scold Me" has never been reissued in stereo: all CD releases feature only the mono mix.

The album was produced by the group's managers, Charles Greene and Brian Stone, each of whom had minimal experience as a record producer, and the band was generally unhappy with the sound of the album and felt that it didn't reflect the intensity of their live shows. The band asked Atco for time to re-record the album, but the label, not wanting to miss the Christmas holiday season, insisted that the record be released as it was. However, the label did give Stills and Young permission to personally mix the mono version of the LP themselves, and the Buffalo Springfield have long insisted that their mono version was superior to the stereo version.

In 1997, Buffalo Springfield was remastered and issued with two versions on the same CD, the mono tracks from Atco 33-200 first, then the stereo tracks from SD 33-200A. Not contained were the stereo mix of "Baby Don't Scold Me" from Atco SD 33-200 or the mono mix of "For What It's Worth" from Atco 33-200A. Strangely, "Burned" has also never been issued in stereo for unknown reasons. It redundantly appears twice on this CD in mono.
