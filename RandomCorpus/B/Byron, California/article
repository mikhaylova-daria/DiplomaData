Byron Hot Springs

Byron, California is also home to the somewhat well-known and historical Byron Hot Springs, a now-abandoned resort that was a retreat that attracted many movie stars and famous athletes in the early 1900s. The first hotel was built in 1889 and was a three-story wood building, with a few cottages scattered nearby, as well as a laundry, gas plant and ice plant, all of which were destroyed by fire on July 25, 1901. A second hotel, also three stories, but made of stucco was constructed 1901-1902, but it burned on July 18, 1912. The third and final hotel, a four-story brick structure was built in 1913 and still stands.

In 1938 the resort closed, after a series of lawsuits that were probably brought about by the Great Depression, but was leased by the government in 1941 and became a military interrogation camp housing both German and Japanese prisoners of war, known as Camp Tracy, until 1945, when orders were sent to dismantle it. Additional information about its usage during WWII can be found in the book, The History of Camp Tracy: Japanese WWII POWs and the Future of Strategic Interrogation.

In 1947 the Byron Hot Springs property was put up for sale and purchased by the Greek Orthodox Church for a sum of $105,000. It served as the Monastery St. Paul for several years. It then changed hands several times both as a resort, country club and private residence. It is currently privately owned by a developer who hopes to begin restoring the resort in early 2009, but the property is now in a state of disrepair. Plans for the restoration of Byron Hot Springs are outlined at byronhotsprings.com. In 2005, a Victorian-era carriage house on the property was burned to the ground. The hotel itself sustained some fire damage, but still stands. The site has most recently attracted graffiti artists, urban explorers, and photographers. The site has notably been used as the set of national Bay Area rap artist Mars for various projects including his Zodiac Tour commercial, and an interview with Insane Clown Posse on their Weekly Freakly Weekly internet news show. DJ Clay, who is also the DJ for Insane Clown Posse shot parts of his music video for his single Pen & Paper.
 

Byron Hot Springs is located south-southeast of Byron. A post office operated at Byron Hot Springs from 1889 to 1930.
