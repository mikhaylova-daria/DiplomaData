CBW is the call sign of the CBC Radio One station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The station broadcasts at AM 990, and this station functions as a Class A clear channel station under former North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement allocations. 

Due to the station's transmitter power and Manitoba's mostly flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity), it reaches almost all of southern Manitoba during the day and much of the middle portion of North America at night.

History

It was part of the Trans-Canada Network, which was the main CBC radio network, while CKRC carried programming from the Dominion Network between January 1, 1944 and 1962.

The transmitter was originally located in Carman, Manitoba. On February 3, 1952, a small plane with 3 passengers struck the Carman tower, due to heavy fog. None of the passengers survived. In November 1964, CBC opened a centralized antenna, and transferred the CBW signal to Starbuck, Manitoba. On October 15, 1993, CBW began broadcasting from a transmitter site in Springstein, Manitoba, while the 98.3 FM signal remained at the Starbuck tower.

CBW moved from the 3rd floor of the Telephone Building on Portage Avenue East to their current location at 541 Portage Ave, activating their new equipment on July 5, 1953, and officially opening on September 25, 1953. Over the next week the station held Open House tours of the station. The building cost $1 million to construct and was state of the art at the time.

Today, CBW shares this same location with CBW-FM and CBWT.

On March 16, 2006, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application by the station to implement a new FM transmitter in Winnipeg itself to simulcast the AM programming due to poor AM coverage in parts of the city. CBW-1-FM 89.3 operates from a transmitter atop the Richardson Building. Its effective radiated power is 2,800 watts. The main CBW transmitter site is west of Winnipeg, south of White Plains, Manitoba on Highway 424.

The call sign CBW was previously used by the CBC Radio station in Windsor, Ontario in 1937-38 until it was shut down.
