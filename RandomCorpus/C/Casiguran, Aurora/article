Etyology
According to folk legend, the name Casiguran was obtained from the Hispano-Filipino term Kasiguruhan which means "safety" or "assurance", such as a fortress or sanctuary for sailing ships during stormy weather. Another legend says that if an unmarried stranger comes to the place, he unavoidably falls in love and marries and most of the time stays for good.

History
Casiguran was founded by the Spanish Missionaries on June 13, 1609. Prior to their arrival, early settlers were the Dumagats and Aetas, followed by migrants from other parts of the Philippines. These migrants spoke different languages such as Ilocano, Visayan languages, Bikol languages, Kapampangan, Gaddang, Itawis and Ibanag, and from these a Kasiguranin dialect evolved. 

In 1942, invading Japanese forces landed in the town of Casiguran. In 1945, Allied troops as well as Philippine Commonwealth forces and recognized guerrilla units during the Battle of Casiguran at the end of World War II.

When the Philippines regained sovereignty in 1946, Aurora was still part of Tayabas Province (now Quezon Province) and Casiguran was a lone northern town. Its political jurisdiction is bounded on the north by the province of Isabela, on the west by Quirino, and on the south west by Barangay Dinadiawan, which was then the boundary between Baler and Casiguran.

In 1959 and 1966, the barrios of Dilasag and Dinalungan, which were part of Casiguran and situated on its northern and southwestern portions, were made into municipalities.

A total of 34 local leaders administered the municipality of Casiguran since its establishment as a community and creation as a municipality. At present, the incumbent municipal mayor is Hon. Reynaldo Teh Bitong, the 34th to hold the post.

Demographics


In 1960, the population of Casiguran was 6,900. This was almost doubled by the 1970s when population was 12,128, an increase of about 76% (5.8% annual average growth rate). Between 1970 and 1975, there was a marked decreased in the number of population from 12,128 to 11,670. This reduction was due to deteriorated peace and order, which forced some of the population to move away. The trend reversed by 1980, with an increase of 19% or an annual average growth rate increase of 3.86%. Increasing population continued during the succeeding censal years (1980 to 1995) but with a declining annual average population growth rate. This is attributed to the gradual stoppage of logging operations in the area. Many workers involved in this trade were not original residents, so when the jobs were no longer available, they left.

Between 1995 and 1999 there was a significant increase of the annual average population growth rate to 4.36%. Population growth continued through the first decade of the 21st century.
