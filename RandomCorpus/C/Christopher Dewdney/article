Christopher Dewdney (born May 9, 1951) is a prize-winning Canadian poet and essayist. He is the son of Canadian artist and author Selwyn Dewdney, brother of Alexander Keewatin Dewdney, and the great-grand-nephew of Edgar Dewdney (Lieutenant-governor: British Columbia 1892—97, Northwest Territories, 1881—88).

Biography
Dewdney was born in London, Ontario, and moved to Toronto in 1980. The London art scene (and, in particular, the artists Greg Curnoe and Jack Chambers), was a major influence on his career, as was his upbringing in a family where science and art were valued highly and in equal measure. That his work reflects this interest in both art and science "is borne out by the fact that his poetry can be found in either the poetry or natural history sections of book stores and libraries".

Currently a professor at the Glendon campus of York University, Dewdney is the long-time partner of writer Barbara Gowdy.

Critical evaluation
"As a poet Dewdney is best known for his pioneering work fusing poetry and science. Soul of the World demonstrates how poets can help us rediscover the wonders that lie hidden within the sciences. It proves that we can sometimes slip through the locked doors that block off the deeper mysteries, using metaphor and the imagination as our keys." Michael Hayward, The Vancouver Sun.

"It is only when we turn to Christopher Dewdney that we discover a poet whose work is made largely of a piece with science." Keith Garebian, The Canadian Forum.

"Within Dewdney's worldview the function of the poet as shaman lies in articulating the link between Umwelt and Innenwelt, between the empirical and the mystic." Karl Jergens, Christopher Dewdney and His Works (1997), ECW Press.

Theoretical contributions
In his 1986 book, The Immaculate Perception, Dewdney was the first author to describe nature as "divine technology," and language as a "cognitive prosthesis." In this same book he refers to language as an organically derived software downloaded into a child's mind at an early age. He writes that this process leaves a wound of alienation, one that lingers invisible in the unconscious. He calls the wound "language acquisition trauma." His two subsequent non-fiction books, The Secular Grail and Last Flesh, deal with consciousness, media and a possible future evolution of humans. In more recent years his nonfiction havs tackled the broader subjects of night and time.
