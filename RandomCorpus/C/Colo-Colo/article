History
The team was founded in early 1925 by Magallanes' footballer David Arellano, who led a group of youngest players who left the club after institutional problems. Finally, on 19 April, Arellano and the youngests officially established the club after meetings and negotiations, where Luis Contreras chose the name of «Colo-Colo» for the club, which refers to the homonymous Mapuche cacique Colocolo.

The team began to play friendly games, but in 1926, Colo-Colo contested the Metropolitan League of Honour, where proclaimed champions and earned the nickname of «invincible». The following year, Colo-Colo became the first Chilean football team to participate in a tour across Europe. However, on 2 May, during an exhibition match against Real Unión Deportiva at Valladolid, the team founder and captain David Arellano was critically injured after suffering a collision with an opposing player that caused him Peritonitis. The inflammation would lead to his death the next day. Despite the great impact caused by the death of Arellano, the club won the tournament of the Central League of football — then renamed Asociación de Football de Santiago — in the 1928, 1929 and 1930 seasons.

In the 1931–32 season, Colo-Colo suffered their first institutional crisis, principally occurring because of financial problems, that led to a serious salary reduction of first team footballers, with their consequent resistance and also of board members. However, in sporting terms, the team played another tournament final, that season against Audax Italiano. But due to a collapse of a platform of the Estadio Italiano and subsequent roughhousing by fans, the game was suspended when the «Albos» was winning 2–1, the match was canceled and the champion position for that year remained vacant. That day's tragedy resulted in 130 injuries and three deaths. Other authors however declared that Audax Italiano was advantageous over Colo-Colo.

One year later, six Santiago based clubs along with Colo-Colo decided to create the first professional league within the country, which was established during 1933. On 23 July, the team won the Campeonato de Apertura (precursor of the Copa Chile), after defeating Unión Española 2–1. However, in the first Primera División official tournament, Colo-Colo finished in the first position of the table alongside Magallanes, who forced the «Cacique» to play a tie-breaker match that Colo-Colo lost 2–1. In 1937, the team was in unbeaten form, obtained their first league title and two seasons later, in 1939, won the league title for the second time under the guidance of the Hungarian coach Francisco Platko, with the highest scorer being Alfonso Domínguez, who scored 20 goals in 24 matches. After another title in 1941 with Platko as coach, seven years later (after two another honours in 1944 and 1947) organized the South American Club Championship — precursor of the Copa Libertadores — in Santiago, having as basis the title obtained the last season. However, the season 1945, the club made their worst campaign in its history, finishing penultimate in the eleventh place over the weak Badminton.

In the early 1950s, club's president Antonio Labán hired Newcastle United striker George Robledo for £25.000, who with his goals led the team to the tournaments of 1953 and 1956. During that decade also, the club acquired a terrain at Macul, where was started the construction of the Estadio Monumental, (hereafter inaugurated in 1975). Despite of that acquisition, the directive invested in a headquarters located at Santiago Centro — address Cienfuegos 41 – in 1953. The 1960s decade, started with the 1960 and 1963 honours, where in the last of these, were broken two records. The first of those, had to do with Luis Hernán Álvarez, who scored 37 goals in a single season, being the highest number of goals scored by a footballer of Colo-Colo during a single season, while the second was the highest number of goals scored by a club – with 130 scores —, also during a football season. Until the late 1960s, the club made regular campaigns, where their rivals Universidad Católica and Universidad de Chile dominated those seasons. However, the team won its tenth honour in 1970.

In 1972, under the orders of the coach Luis Álamos, and with shapes like Carlos Caszely and Francisco Valdés, won another championship, and also obtained the country's attendance record of 45.929 people assistance per match. That team was the basis of the called «Colo-Colo 73», that had the speciality of be the first Chilean team to reach a Copa Libertadores final, which lost against Independiente of Argentina. After of Colo-Colo's brilliant campaign, the club entered into a strong crisis of a playing and institutional character, at least on the field, not getting the league title again until 1979, where highlited another players, like the talented Brazilian midfielder Severino Vasconcelos.

In the 1980s, the club obtained the league titles of 1983 with the coach Pedro García, and the 1986 and 1989 honours under Arturo Salah. The 1987 Alianza Lima air disaster claimed the lives of sixteen players, where Colo-Colo ceded footballers to the Peruvian team. Despite four Copa Chile titles in that decade. However, the great deception in that period were the continental tournaments, where the team only exceeded the first stage of the 1988 Copa Libertadores. On 30 September 1989, the Estadio Monumental, played an opening match against Peñarol, that Colo-Colo won 2–1, with goals of Marcelo Barticciotto and the striker Hugo Rubio for the «Cacique».

The 1990s decade was the most successful in the club's history for the national and international honours achieved. In mid-1990, arrived the Croatian Mirko Jozić as coach, with whom the team won its first «Bicampeonato», after won the title of that year. On 5 June of that year, after beating 3–0 to Olimpia at Monumental, with a twice of Luis Pérez and a goal of Leonel Herrera, Colo-Colo began the first Chilean team in won a Copa Libertadores. The same season, the «Albos» lost the Intercontinental Cup final against Yugoslavian club Red Star Belgrade, after being defeated 3–0 at Tokyo. While in the national plane, the club won its third–consecutive title, achieving its first «Tricampeonato», winning the league title of 1991. The following season, the club won the Recopa Sudamericana, after beating Brazil's Cruzeiro after a penalty shootout, and also obtained the Copa Interamericana, after winning 3–1 against Puebla in Mexico. The last title won by Jozić in Colo-Colo was the 1993 league title, thus closing a successful spell in South America.

After Jozić's departure of the club, in 1994, the club had three coaches in the season: Vicente Cantatore, Eddio Inostroza and Andrés Prieto, finishing fourth in the league, where lost 4–0 the «Superclásico» against Universidad de Chile. Despite of the regular season in the national plane, the team was champion of the Copa Chile and achieved the Copa Libertadores quarterfinals. However, the following season, arrived the Paraguayan Gustavo Benítez as coach, who obtained the 1996, 1997–C and 1998 honours, achieving also the semifinals of the Supercopa Libertadores in 1996, and of the Copa Libertadores in 1997, where was eliminated both times by Cruzeiro. In 1999, Colo-Colo lived a similar situation to 1994, finishing fourth, and also had three coaches in a single season, that were the Brazilian Nelsinho Baptista, the caretaker manager Carlos Durán and then Fernando Morena of Uruguay, who remained until 2001.

In 1999, after Benítez's departure, the club entered in a serious financial crisis – after years of economic mismanagements under the leader Peter Dragicevic as president — it bottomed on 23 January 2002, when the justice declared Colo-Colo in bankruptcy, letting Juan Carlos Saffie as responsible for the institution doesn't lose its legal status. Despite of the bankruptcy, under Jaime Pizarro as coach – key player in the obtaining of the 1991 Copa Libertadores — «Los Albos» won the Torneo de Clausura, with an almost completely juvenile squad. Three years later, in 2005, the joint-stock company Blanco y Negro took the administration, concessioning all assets of the club for thirty years, in exchange for paying all debts through an opening process at Santiago Stock Exchange. However in the first half of 2006, the judiciary court sentenced the end of the debt.

With the Argentine Claudio Borghi as coach since 2006, and also with players like Matías Fernández and Humberto Suazo, Colo-Colo obtained a «Bicampeonato» winning the Apertura and Clausura tournaments, despite of reach another international final, the Copa Sudamericana, where was defeated 2–1 by Mexico's side Pachuca. Also, that season, «El Cacique» was recognized by the IFFHS as the world's club of the month. The following season, Colo-Colo won two consecutive tournaments more, of that form, winning a «Tetracampeonato», and being the first Chilean team achieve that.

After Borghi's departure, the club obtained its 28th title after defeating Palestino in the 2008 Torneo de Clausura finals under the coaching of Marcelo Barticciotto, and with Lucas Barrios as principal scorer, who equaled Luis Hernán Álvarez record of highest number of goals scored by a Colo-Colo footballer during a single season with 37 goals. The following season, the club became the first professional team in play at Easter Island, while after a poor Torneo de Apertura — where was eliminated of the play-offs for first time — «Los Albos» started the Clausura very close of the promotion play-offs place, but however, the team reached the tournament's finals against Universidad Católica, which won 4–2 in Santa Laura, with players like Esteban Paredes, Macnelly Torres and Ezequiel Miralles in that moment, coached by Hugo Tocalli. However in the Copa Libertadores, the club only surpassed the group stage in the 2007 edition.


Badge, colours and kit

The club's badge represents Mapuche chieftain Colocolo (recognized in the Estadio Monumental hall), who led Arauco War against Spanish empire during the 1560s. On 19 April 1925, when the club was established, Luis Contreras — one of the players that founded the club alongside Arellano – defined the team's badge, according Colocolo's legend, which says that he was Palín champion, sport practiced by the Mapuches on both sides competing for win a thick ball of cloth. However, the existence of the Araucan figure has been questioned, such as said Diego Barros Arana in its monumental text called Historia General de Chile. Not obstant, the Spanish writer Jerónimo de Vivar in several of its works, confirms their existence.

For much of the history of the club its home colours have been all black and white, uniform that was defined by Juan Quiñones, according propositions of team's founder David Arellano. In 1927, after the friendly game played with Valladolid based club Real Unión Deportiva, match where Arellano died, the club's shirt wears a black horizontal band, that means the eternal mourning of the institution, being nicknamed The Mourners during the 1930s. Colo-Colo's alternative kit was green during the 1930s, red after 1973 Copa Libertadores campaign under orders of manager Luis Álamos, and then was officially black after 1991 Copa Libertadores title under Mirko Jozić as head coach, being that the third kit in the late 1980s.

In August 2008, during an exhibition match against rivals Universidad de Chile, the team played with a red shirt in honour to 1973 Copa Libertadores runner-up squad on hands of Avellaneda based-club Independiente. On 25 March 2010, occurred a similar situation, when during a match played at José Amalfitani Stadium with Vélez Sarsfield for Copa Libertadores, the team wore the uniform when Colo-Colo defeated Botafogo at Maracanã (black shirt, white shorts & red socks), again making reference to that mitical squad of players like Carlos Caszely or Adolfo Nef.

Colo-Colo initially played on a fields like Estadio El Llano (1925–1927) and Campos de Sports de Ñuñoa (1928–1938), close to the current Estadio Nacional, where the club played as local between 1939 and late 1980s, because the construction of its home ground. The club's first own stadium was Estadio de Carabineros, which was acquired by the «Albos» in a CLP 5 million fee on 10 May 1946. However, "Fortín Mapocho" — commonly known of that form in the 1940s – was sold to the workers' compensation in $33 million pesos, transaction that partly funded the purchase of terrain, where was later built Estadio Monumental.

In 1956, Antonio Labán, club's president, acquired a 28 Ha terrain at Macul, starting of this form the construction of the team's home ground, close to the intersection between Vicuña Mackenna and Departamental. Originally, was raised a construction of a stadium of 120.000 espectators, not obstant, the high cost of the work prevented complete the project without a state subsidy. However, with the asignation of Chile for held the 1962 FIFA World Cup, but the 9.5 magnitude 1960 earthquake, added to a congressional veto provision delivering public money to nongovernmental entities that discarded the initiative.

Then, with the budget reached between 1972 and 1975, the club achieved the stadium's construction, which was inaugurated during a Campeonato Nacional game against Deportes Aviación. Not obstant, the lack of basic services caused the closure of the ground. However, Pedreros' ground was finally opened in 1989, is believed that the dictator Augusto Pinochet helped end the constructions, but in fact, this had no effect, it was only a broken promise, because in that moment was holding the plebiscite of 1989, which would decide whether the dictator would follow as president. If construction was feasible thanks to the amount of US$1 million fee received for the transfer of the striker Hugo Rubio to Serie A club Bologna. The ground was inaugurated in a friendly match with Uruguayan side Peñarol, that Colo-Colo won 2–1, where the Argentine Marcelo Barticciotto scored the first goal in the stadium's history.
