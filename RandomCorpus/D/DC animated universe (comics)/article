While Batman and Superman had their own animated series and comic book follow-ups, the rest of the characters in the would appear in the following comics often.
The Batman Adventures

The Batman Adventures was created as a comic book tie-in to Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures. Various titles related to the animated series ran from 1992 to 2004, along with various mini-series and one-shots.

Superman Adventures

Similar to The Batman Adventures, Superman Adventures was created as a comic book tie-in to Superman: The Animated Series. It ran between 1996 to 2002.

Gotham Girls


Adventures in the DC Universe

Adventures in the DC Universe is the title of a comic book published by DC Comics. Following on from Batman Adventures and Superman Adventures, Adventures in the DC Universe used the same "animated style" as seen in the DC Animated Universe, but focused on a rotating cast of characters from throughout the DC Universe.

Most of the characters appearing in this series had yet to be seen in any DC Animated Universe series and, as such, their designs and histories were quite different from their appearances in the television series, such as Justice League. For example, Kyle Rayner often appears in this series, but he appears to be far less like his animated-series counterpart (who had not yet appeared on Superman: The Animated Series), and is more reflective, both visually and historically, of the character appearing in the regular DC Universe comics.

Justice League Adventures / Justice League Unlimited

Justice League Adventures is a DC comic book series featuring the Justice League, but set in the continuity (and style) of the television shows Justice League and Justice League Unlimited; as opposed to the regular DC Universe.

It is a sister title to Batman Adventures (based on Batman: The Animated Series) and Superman Adventures (based on Superman: The Animated Series).

Justice League Adventures ran for 34 issues from 2002–2004 before being restarted under the title Justice League Unlimited (to match the recreation and renaming of the television series). The new title ran for 46 issues from 2004–2008 before being canceled in May 2008, ending the last production of the DC Animated Universe.

Batman Beyond and the Beyond universe

Batman Beyond also received a number of on-going and mini-series related to the series. Due to the popularity of the Batman Beyond concept, numerous tie-ins and cameos were created as a bridge between the DC animated universe and the DC Universe. Since 2012, DC Comics publishes three weekly digital series related to Batman Beyond, as prints them monthly as Batman Beyond Unlimited.
