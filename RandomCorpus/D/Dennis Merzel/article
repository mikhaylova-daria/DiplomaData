Dennis Merzel is an American Zen and spirituality teacher, also known as Genpo Merzel Roshi.

Biography
Early life
Dennis Paul Merzel, known as Genpo Roshi, was born on June 3, 1944 in Brooklyn, New York and was raised and schooled in Long Beach, California. His family was Jewish (his grandfather was a Rabbi), but he was raised as an agnostic by his father and as an atheist by his mother. He was a champion swimmer and an all-American water polo player. He was a lifeguard and began teaching public school while obtaining a Master's degree in educational administration from the University of Southern California.

Zen Buddhism
While on a trip in 1971 to the Mojave Desert in California with two friends, Merzel had what he described as an "awakening experience". Following this, he left his career as a school teacher for a year to live in the mountains alone in a cabin near San Luis Obispo. In 1972 he met the Japanese-born Zen teacher Taizan Maezumi, and moved to Los Angeles to study under him. 
Merzel was ordained as an unsui, or novice priest, in 1973. In 1980, a year after completing formal Kōan study, Merzel received dharma transmission, becoming Maezumi's second Dharma successor. In 1981 Merzel underwent zuise in Japan, and in 1988 he was officially installed as abbot of Hosshinji Zen temple in Bar Harbor, Maine. In 1995 Merzel received the title of Dendō-kyōshi Kenshuso, a now defunct category officially recognizing Western Zen priests by the Sōtō School Headquarters in Japan (Sōtō-shū) . In 1996 Merzel received Inka from Bernie Glassman, after Maezumi's death in 1995. This made Merzel Bernie Glassman's first Inka successor and made him the second in Maezumi Roshi's lineage to be recognized as a Zen Master.

Merzel is the founder and former Abbot of Kanzeon Zen Center.
 
After studying voice dialogue with Hal and Sidra Stone he developed the Big Mind Process™, which combines "Eastern, Buddhist insights with Western psychoanalytical ideas." Merzel has organized Big Mind™ retreats and events nationally and internationally, such as an annual event in the Netherlands that has attracted hundreds of participants. A randomized clinical trial of Merzel's Big Mind method showed statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups for all parameters measured, though Johnson notes that the reported effects may also result from factors such as group effect, suggestibility, and/or simple expectation, and that the study may have limited generalizability due to the high level of education of the participants.

Resignation from White Plum
In 1988 Merzel was installed as abbot at Hosshinji, a Zen temple in Bar Harbor, Maine. He was alleged to have had a romantic relationship with a student, leading to the dissolution of the temple. 

In August 1992, a group of 12 American Zen teachers sent a letter to Taizan Maezumi, expressing concern about Merzel's relationships with a number of female students, his lack of remorse, and his lack of responsibility. They asked Maezumi to withdraw Merzel's sanction to teach.

In February 2011, after admitting to three extra-marital affairs, Merzel said he would disrobe as a Buddhist priest, resign as an elder of the White Plum Asanga, step down as Abbot of Kanzeon, and stop teaching for an indefinite period to seek counseling.

Forty-four American Buddhist teachers wrote a letter suggesting that Merzel take a minimum one-year break from teaching and seek therapy.

By April, Merzel had reversed his position, saying that too many students and his organizations depended on him financially and spiritually. 

Sixty-six American Buddhist teachers responded with a public letter to Merzel requesting that he follow through with his stated intention to stop teaching for some time. Merzel continued to lead retreats.
It was reported that he and his wife were divorcing.

He continues to serve as president and abbot of Kanzeon Zen Center, now called Big Heart Zen Sangha.
