Done by the Forces of Nature is the second studio album by American hip hop group Jungle Brothers, released November 9, 1989, on Warner Bros. Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in 1989 at Calliope Studios in New York City, and production was handled by the Jungle Brothers. It was mixed at Apollo Studios by Kool DJ Red Alert and the Jungle Brothers. The album's title may refer to a line from the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture, wherein Krishna says, "Those who are deluded by the illusive power (Maya) of Nature become attached to the work done by the forces of nature," 3:28.

Done by the Forces of Nature peaked at number 46 on Billboards Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It also received rave reviews from music critics who praised its Afrocentric themes, clever lyrics, house-influenced production, and eclectic sampling of music genres such as jazz, R&B, funk, and African music. Done by the Forces of Nature has been considered a golden age hip hop classic, as well as one of the greatest and influential hip hop albums of all time. In 1998, The Source magazine selected the album as one of its 100 Best Rap Albums.

Critical reception

Done by the Forces of Nature was well received by music critics. In his review for Spin magazine, Greg Tate hailed the production as "the first hip house combination that puts a nastier spin on both groove formats" and called the album "a nonstop groove-a-think where sexist spectacle commingles with love paeans to the sistuhs, where safaris into Afro-centricity are made to house you." Robert Tanzilo of the Chicago Tribune called it "one of the brightest records of the year". Duff Marlowe of the Los Angeles Times praised the album's diverse sound and lyrical themes, including social consciousness and individual self-realization. He wrote that the Jungle Brothers "present a vision of urbanized naturalism, a subversive and funky anti-intellectualism". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called the album "some seriously intense music that makes the commercial raps of Tone-Loc and DJ Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince sound like a child's play". Peter Watrous of The New York Times observed lyrical allusions to hip hop and African-American culture that are "enriching an always solid dance beat".

Rolling Stone writer Michael Azerrad praised the album's lyrical substance and said that "the Jungle Brothers' positive, spiritual vibe (a direct descendant of Earth, Wind and Fire's) is as hip as their music". Yahoo! Music's Brett Anderson described it as the Jungle Brothers' "stab at edutainment". Steve Huey of Allmusic praised the album's eclectic sound and sampling of music genres such as jazz, R&B, and African music. In comparing the album to the Jungle Brothers' landmark debut album, Straight Out the Jungle (1988), Huey wrote that Done by the Forces of Nature "feels more realized in many respects, and is arguably the more satisfying listen". French newspaper Le Monde called the album "brilliant". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice found its sound "as original as De La Soul's, and the dreams of pleasure are straight out the urban jungle":



 Legacy and influence 
The album has been considered a classic of hip hop's golden age and one of the most influential albums in hip hop. It has also been described by critics as an "underrated classic". Michael Azerrad, writing in Trouser Press, said that it was "largely overlooked," but is "one of rap's finest hours" with a "highly musical hip-hop" that "radiates upbeat spirituality". The Chicago Tribunes Rick Reger called it a "masterpiece ... one of hip-hop's most imaginative, engaging records". In retrospect, Rolling Stones Nathan Brackett wrote "At their prime in the late '80s, the Jungle Brothers reflected all of hip-hop's potential – their second album, 1989's spiritual, street-wise Done by the Forces of Nature, was as conscious as it was funky and stands out as one of the most overlooked rap albums of that decade." The Rolling Stone Album Guide comments that the "Jungle Brothers were ahead of their time" with the album and cites the track "Doin' Our Own Dang" as "the definitive Native Tongues posse cut". Rolling Stone placed it thirty-seventh on its list of the 50 Coolest Records of All Time. In 1998, Done by the Forces of Nature was selected as one of The Sources 100 Best Rap Albums.
