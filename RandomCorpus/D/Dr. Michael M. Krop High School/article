Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School is a secondary school located at 1411 County Line Road in the Ives Estates, an unincorporated area of north Miami-Dade County (Miami address), Florida, USA. However, it serves the city of Aventura, northern fringes of North Miami Beach, and the unincorporated areas around the school such as Ives Estates and Ojus; its principal is Dawn Baglos. The school is located on the Miami-Dade side of the Miami-Dade-Broward County line and it is the northernmost high school in the district.

Krop is considered to be a magnet school because it has a "Students Training in the Arts Repertory (STAR)" program. This magnet program is a visual and performing arts program that is open to students in the greater Miami area. Due to the recession of 2008 and ongoing financial issues, the STAR program has had severe cuts in its funding. 

The school gained national attention after one of its students, Trayvon Martin, was killed in a controversial shooting.

The school's athletic rival is Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.

History
Built on a former landfill, construction for Dr. Michael M. Krop High School began in 1996 after the Miami-Dade School Board approved plans to build a new high school in North Miami-Dade County to lessen overcrowding in local elementary and secondary schools, including North Miami Beach High School. Opening its doors in 1998, Krop began with 9th and 10th grades and eventually added 11th and 12th grades; its first graduating class was the class of 2001. At the time of its opening, Krop had a total enrollment of 1,475 students.

In early 1998, before its opening, the naming of the school triggered some controversy, as letters from members of the community indicated a preference for a more generic name. Michael Krop High School is named after Dr. Michael M. Krop, an orthodontist born in 1930 who was first elected to the Miami-Dade School Board in 1980. Krop retired from the board in 2004, after 24 years of service. Former board members Janet McAliley and Betsy Kaplan accused Michael Krop of lobbying to have the school named for him on separate occasions, a charge which Krop denied. On February 17, 1998: The city council of Aventura, Florida issued a resolution urging the Miami-Dade County school board to name the new high school in northeast Miami-Dade County "Dr. Michael M. Krop High School."

When Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus opened in 2009, it relieved Krop High. Golden Beach, Sunny Isles Beach, and portions of North Miami Beach were rezoned to Mourning from Krop.
